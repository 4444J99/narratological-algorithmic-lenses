## II. Three-Act Paradigm Assessment

| Element | Classical Target | Open View Actual | Variance | Assessment |
|---------|------------------|------------------|----------|------------|
| **Act I (Setup)** | 20-25% | 33% (Prologue + Act I) | +8-13% | Extended setup |
| **Act II (Confrontation)** | 50-55% | 39% | -11-16% | Compressed |
| **Act III (Resolution)** | 20-25% | 28% | +3% | Slightly extended but INCOMPLETE |
| **Inciting Incident** | 10-15% | Line 222 (8%) | On target | Divorce announcement |
| **Plot Point 1** | 25% | Line 926 (33%) | +8% | Family dispersal |
| **Midpoint** | 50% | ~Line 1540 (55%) | +5% | HQ acknowledges Li as wild card |
| **Plot Point 2** | 75% | Line 2167 (77%) | +2% | Front door traps Rok's foot |
| **Climax** | 85-95% | Lines 2762-2777 (98%) | Very late | Rok drowns with Gre |
| **Resolution** | 95-100% | ABSENT | CRITICAL GAP | Script terminates mid-action |

**Fit Assessment:** ●●○○○

The script partially follows three-act structure but with significant deviations:
- Extended setup (Prologue + Act I = 33%)
- Compressed confrontation despite extensive parallel storylines
- Third act is structurally incomplete—script terminates mid-scene

---

## III. Five-Movement Paradigm Assessment

The script operates closer to **European art cinema structure** than classical Hollywood three-act:

                  Formal thesis; four private rituals; loops merge

    Movement II:  DOMESTIC RUPTURE (163-926)
                  Divorce declared; breakfast dynamics; Black Box arrives;
                  Lef introduced in grow tank

    Movement III: PARALLEL BETRAYALS (927-2035)
                  Each family member's separate crisis/betrayal;
                  HQ subplot develops; evening convergence

    Movement IV:  SIEGE & LEF'S DEATH (2036-2486)
                  House locks down; family watches Lef boil and die;
                  Black Box articulates mandate; family disperses to rooms

    Movement V:   JUDGMENT & DISSOLUTION (2487-2810) [INCOMPLETE]
                  Individual "tests"; moral choices; Rok drowns;
                  Li revealed as collaborator
```

**Fit Assessment:** ●●●○○

The five-movement structure fits better than three-act, but Movement V is incomplete—the script terminates before resolution.

## IV. Complete Turning Point Inventory

| Node | Line | Event | Structural Function |
|------|------|-------|---------------------|
| **Hook** | 1-16 | Black screen; logo; timestamp; quadrant split | Formal conceit established |
| **Thematic Statement** | 140-151 | Four loops sync and merge into single image | Visual thesis: separate dysfunctions become unified prison |
| **Inciting Incident** | 222-224 | Li: "We are getting divorced." | Sets family dissolution in motion |
| **Black Box Arrival** | 593-668 | Drone drops box; Rok brings inside; TIMECODE 00:00:00 | External threat activated; game begins |
| **Lef Reveal** | 857-924 | Grow tank shown; "Estimated Time of Arrival: One month" | Central symbolic image; stakes established |
| **First HQ Reveal** | 945-958 | Control room; silhouetted figures watching | Surveillance-as-antagonist introduced |
| **End of Act One** | 926 | Family disperses; Lef's ETA established | Transition to parallel structure |
| **Li's Violence** | 1497-1527 | Li stomps Def's face with boot heel | Hidden capacity for violence revealed |

## V. Tension/Intensity Analysis

### Movement-by-Movement Intensity

| Movement | Average Intensity | Peak | Trough | Assessment |
|----------|-------------------|------|--------|------------|
| I: Overture | 3/10 | 5 (loop merge) | 2 (static) | Appropriate for formal prologue |
| II: Domestic | 5/10 | 7 (bathroom argument) | 3 (breakfast) | Good escalation |
| III: Parallel | 6/10 | 9 (Li's violence) | 4 (transitions) | Peaks well but valleys drag |
| IV: Siege | 9/10 | 10 (Lef's death) | 7 (doorbell) | Sustained high intensity |
| V: Judgment | 8/10 | 10 (Rok drowns) | 6 (HQ scenes) | High but incomplete |

### Intensity Curve Diagnosis

The script follows a generally ascending intensity curve appropriate for thriller/horror, with the critical exception that it terminates before resolution. The current ending at peak tension creates frustration rather than catharsis.

---

## VI. Protagonist Analysis

### Configuration

```
PROTAGONIST CONFIGURATION:

  [X] Ensemble protagonist (fragmented across family)
  [X] Li as most active agent

  Relationship to CDQ: Li embodies the central question—she initiates
  divorce, maintains affair, commits violence, and is revealed as
  collaborator. Her arc: from apparent victim to complicit participant.

ANTAGONIST CONFIGURATION:

  [X] Institutional antagonist (HQ/surveillance apparatus)
  [X] Distributed antagonist (all-woman control room)
  [X] Abstract antagonist (the system itself)

  The family is also antagonist to itself—dysfunction weaponized.
```

### Li's Arc (Primary Protagonist)

| Phase | Lines | State | Action | Revelation |
|-------|-------|-------|--------|------------|
| Prologue | 18-51 | Arrives exhausted | Enters home; scanned; looped | Subject of surveillance |
| Act I | 163-926 | Announces divorce | Reveals Lef burden | "Wave of dread" |
| Act II | 960-1527 | McDonald's peace | Affair with Def → STOMPS FACE | Capacity for violence |
| Act III | 2036-2810 | Watches Lef die | Slaps Rok; watches tests | REVEALED AS COLLABORATOR |

**Arc Type:** Revelational (true nature gradually exposed)

**Assessment:** Li functions as protagonist but her arc is incomplete. The final revelation (collaborator with HQ) is introduced at line 2806 but never dramatized—we don't see the consequences or understand her motivation.

---

## VII. Subplot Integration Assessment

### Subplot Inventory

| Subplot | Characters | Lines | Integration Score | Assessment |
|---------|------------|-------|-------------------|------------|
| **HQ Control Room** | Wot, Jra, Lon | ~300 | ●●○○○ (20%) | Parallel but disconnected |
| **Fre's Affair** | Fre, Nol | ~250 | ●●●○○ (40%) | Character depth but no payoff |
| **Sus's Abuse** | Sus, Mis Sar | ~200 | ●○○○○ (10%) | Introduced then abandoned |
| **Rok's Sexuality** | Rok, Gre, Em | ~300 | ●●○○○ (30%) | Setup for test; partially paid off |
| **Li's Affair** | Li, Def | ~150 | ●●●●○ (60%) | Reveals character; affects plot |

### Integration Failures

1. **HQ Subplot:** Consumes significant page space but never explains why this family or what the game accomplishes. Wot, Jra, and Lon remain abstractions.

2. **Sus/Mis Sar:** The sexual abuse thread is introduced with disturbing specificity (lines 1172-1248) then dropped until the "test" where Mis Sar appears in the shower. The abuse is never confronted or resolved.

3. **Lon's Rebellion:** "She's here to burn it down" (line 1435) promises sabotage that barely materializes. Lon's actions at the end are sketched in narrative notes rather than dramatized.

## VIII. Time Structure Analysis

### Chronology

| Period | Lines | Duration | Events |
|--------|-------|----------|--------|
| Evening Day 1 | 163-320 | ~2 hours | Divorce announced; lights out |
| Morning Day 2 | 324-926 | ~4 hours | Routines; breakfast; Black Box arrives |
| Day 2 Parallel | 927-1920 | ~8 hours | Each family member's separate day |
| Evening Day 2 | 1920-2035 | ~1 hour | Convergence; alarm begins |
| Night Day 2 | 2036-2810 | ~2-3 hours | Siege; Lef dies; tests; [INCOMPLETE] |

**Total Elapsed Time:** ~24-36 hours (one full day cycle)

**Time Pressure:** The TIMECODE countdown (from -08:37:98 to 00:00:00) provides external time pressure, but its meaning is never fully explained. What happens at zero? The Black Box "activates," but the connection between countdown and game rules remains vague.

---

## IX. Genre Structure Assessment

### Genre Hybridization

```
GENRE LAYERS:

Primary:   DOMESTIC DRAMA / CHAMBER PIECE
           Family dysfunction; marital dissolution; parental failure

Secondary: TECHNO-THRILLER / SURVEILLANCE HORROR
           Smart house; observation apparatus; loss of control

Tertiary:  REALITY TV CRITIQUE / MEDIA SATIRE
           "Splayed, weighed, and displayed"; family as content

Quaternary: BODY HORROR
            Grow tank; boiling child; physical entrapment
```

### Genre Expectations vs. Delivery

| Genre | Expectation | Delivery | Assessment |
|-------|-------------|----------|------------|
| Domestic Drama | Relationship resolution | Marriage ends; no reconciliation | ✓ Subverts |
| Thriller | Protagonist defeats antagonist | Protagonist revealed as collaborator | ✓ Subverts |
| Horror | Final girl survives | Sus survives test but fate unclear | ⚠ Incomplete |
| Satire | System critique articulated | "Splayed, weighed, displayed" | ✓ Delivered |

**Closest Analogues:**
- Haneke's *Funny Games* (home invasion; metafictional cruelty)
- Black Mirror's "White Bear" (punishment as entertainment)
- Fassbinder's domestic melodramas (marriage as warfare)

## X. Structural Diagnosis Summary

### Strongest Structural Elements

1. **Formal Prologue:** The quadrant overture (lines 1-162) is genuinely original—four private rituals syncing into unified image is a memorable thesis statement.

2. **Parallel Structure:** The Act II dispersal into four character threads creates textured world-building even if binding is weak.

3. **Lef's Death Sequence:** Lines 2237-2395 achieve sustained horror through helplessness—the family can only watch as their child dies.

### Weakest Structural Elements

1. **Incomplete Third Act:** The script terminates mid-scene. The "moral tests" are sketched in narrative notes (line 2717) rather than dramatized. Li's collaborator reveal gets two lines.

2. **HQ Subplot Failure:** Wot, Jra, and Lon consume ~300 lines without affecting the family's situation or explaining the game's purpose.

3. **Weak Causal Binding:** The script operates primarily on AND THEN logic. The Black Box activates at TIMECODE 00:00:00, but nothing the family does triggers this—it's arbitrary.

### Proportional Issues

| Section | Current | Target | Action |
|---------|---------|--------|--------|
| Prologue + Act I | 33% | 25% | Compress ~100 lines |
| Act II | 39% | 50% | Maintain but tighten |
| Act III | 28% | 25% | COMPLETE (add 15-25 pages) |

---

## XI. Recommendations

### Critical Structural Revisions

1. **Complete Act III:** The moral choice mechanics (line 2717) need full dramatization. What happens when Sus chooses revenge? What happens when Rok drowns? What are the consequences for the surviving family members?

2. **Resolve or Remove HQ:** Either integrate HQ into the family's experience (they see the watchers; they understand the game) or cut the subplot entirely and let the surveillance remain mysterious.

3. **Establish Causal Logic:** Connect Black Box activation to a family action. Why this family? Why tonight? Even a single line of explanation would strengthen the architecture.

4. **Complete Li's Arc:** Her collaborator reveal needs consequences. Did she know Lef would die? Did she choose this? Can she escape?

### Priority Order

1. Complete Act III (15-25 pages)
2. Clarify causal connection between family and game
3. Decide HQ subplot: cut or integrate
4. Resolve Sus/Mis Sar thread
5. Resolve Rok's survival/death
