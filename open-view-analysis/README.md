# OPEN VIEW — Complete Analysis Archive

**Project:** OPEN VIEW Screenplay Analysis
**Protocol:** P7 COMPREHENSIVE + Protocol Worksheets
**Analyst:** Claude (narratological-algorithms skill)
**Archive Date:** 2026-01-26
**Status:** COMPLETE (P7) + WORKSHEETS READY

---

## Overview

This archive contains comprehensive P7 COMPREHENSIVE protocol analyses for multiple drafts of the OPEN VIEW screenplay, a formally ambitious work combining domestic drama, reality TV critique, and survival horror into a meditation on family dysfunction as entertainment product.

Both P7 analyses represent the full treatment: 8 core documents plus 5 supplements, totaling 13 documents per draft.

Additionally, this archive includes **Protocol Worksheets** for applying three distinct narratological frameworks (Fleabag, Curb Your Enthusiasm, South Park) to screenplay analysis.

## Key Evolution: First → Second Draft

### Improvements Made

1. **Third Act Completion:** First draft terminated mid-climax; second draft has full resolution
2. **Causal Binding Strengthened:** From 27% to 78% "therefore" connectors
3. **Character Consolidation:** HQ subplot appears reduced/integrated
4. **Length Expansion:** +967 lines (~34% increase) for fuller dramatization
5. **Structure Extension:** Added Movement VI (Coda/Afterlives)

### Persistent Issues

1. **Movement II/III sprawl** requiring compression
2. **Motivation opacity** for Son's conspiracy
3. **Relationship development** between Mom/Sis
4. **Causal binding** between game activation and character action

### Character Name Evolution

| First Draft | Second Draft |
|-------------|--------------|
| Li | Mom |
| Fre | Dad |
| Sus | Sis |
| Rok | Son |
| Lef | (removed?) |
| Wot, Jra, Lon | Leader, Auntie |

## Protocol Information

**P7 COMPREHENSIVE** is the most extensive analysis protocol in the narratological-algorithms framework, designed for major works requiring archival-quality documentation. It activates all 9 analyst roles:

| Role | Function |
|------|----------|
| AESTHETE | Visual and formal analysis |
| DRAMATURGIST | Structural architecture |
| NARRATOLOGIST | Story mechanics |
| ART_HIST | Contextual positioning |
| CINEPHILE | Comparative film knowledge |
| RHETORICIAN | Argument and persuasion |
| PRODUCER | Commercial viability |
| ACADEMIC | Theoretical frameworks |
| FIRST-READER | Emotional engagement |

---

## Document Count Summary

| Category | Documents | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| First Draft P7 | 13 | Core 8 + Supplements 5 |
| Second Draft P7 | 10 | Core 8 + Supplements 2 |
| Protocol Worksheets (Core) | 5 | 3 protocols + overview + synthesis |
| Genre Multiplicity Framework | 3 | Extension + architecture + meta-genre |
| Mythological-Autobiographical | 1 | Athamas & Ino → Open View mapping |
| **Archive Total** | **32** | Plus indexes and README |

---

## Protocol Worksheets

### Three Analytical Lenses

| Protocol | Source | Core Mechanism | Diagnostic Focus |
|----------|--------|----------------|------------------|
| **Fleabag** | Phoebe Waller-Bridge | Direct address + emotional deflection | Intimacy architecture, confession mechanics, fourth-wall strategy |
| **Curb** | Larry David | Collision comedy + social contract violation | Setup/payoff threading, embarrassment escalation, causal binding |
| **South Park** | Stone & Parker | Extreme position + satirical inversion | Thematic clarity, "therefore/but" logic, ideological stress-testing |

### Triangulation Method

1. Run each worksheet independently against a draft
2. Compare findings using the synthesis matrix
3. Where protocols converge = structural strength
4. Where protocols diverge = genre-specific opportunity
5. Where all protocols flag weakness = critical revision target

### Application to *Open View*

The surveillance premise offers unique multi-protocol opportunities:

| Protocol | Surveillance Functions As... |
|----------|------------------------------|
| Fleabag | The audience within the world (characters always "watched") |
| Curb | Infinite witness multiplier (maximum embarrassment potential) |
| South Park | Position to satirize (both pro- and anti-surveillance extremes) |

---

## Genre Multiplicity Framework

### The Third Draft Experiment

The third draft (2019-10-31) introduces an explicit formal experiment:

> **"Be genre-less, or be all the genres, or cycle through the genres as the scene/moment/beat demands."**

Each character inhabits their own genre register; collision between characters becomes collision between genres.

| Character | Assigned Genre | Evidence |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| Emma | Domestic Gothic / Melodrama | Americana kitchen, storm clouds, blood in drain, "mournful sip" |
| Beth | Psychological Thriller | Withholding information, cryptic arrival, clone reveal |
| Clipper | Romantic Comedy | Rehearsed pitch, wounded by rejection, hopeful dinner |
| Helen | Corporate Satire / Mumblecore | "Why do we even work?" / device addiction / transactional |
| Dayla | Competition Reality | White void studio, elimination format, names called |

### Genre Multiplicity Documents

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Genre Multiplicity Extension** | Adds genre-awareness diagnostics to each core protocol |
| **Genre Architecture Worksheet** | Maps character-genre assignments and collision points |
| **Meta-Genre Container Analysis** | Explores how surveillance functions as the genre that contains all genres |
| **Mythological Mapping** | Traces inheritance from Athamas & Ino myth through adaptations to Open View |

### Surveillance as Meta-Genre Container

```
SURVEILLANCE (meta-genre)
      │
      ├── Contains: All character genres as "performances"
      ├── Enforces: Genre roles through watching/judgment
      ├── Reveals: Genre as costume, not identity
      └── Climax: Characters discover/resist/transcend assignment
```

### The Genreless Goal

| Arc Stage | Character Status | Genre Status |
|-----------|------------------|--------------|
| Opening | Trapped in assigned genre | Genre as prison |
| Midpoint | Recognizes genre limitations | Genre as costume |
| Climax | Chooses genre (or no genre) | Genre as tool |
| Resolution | Genre-fluid | Genre as expression |

---

## Mythological-Autobiographical Layer

### Source Material

Open View inherits structural and thematic DNA from two sources:

1. **Ovid's Metamorphoses (Book IV)** — The Athamas & Ino myth
2. **Three Athamas & Ino Adaptations** — Original screenplay drafts (2018)
3. **Autobiographical Experience** — Family divorce and the "running away" pattern

### The Athamas & Ino Myth

| Character | Function | Fate |
|-----------|----------|------|
| **Athamas** | Father/King | Driven mad by Furies; kills son mistaking him for prey |
| **Ino** | Mother | Flees with younger child; leaps off cliff |
| **Learchus** | Older child | Killed by father |
| **Melicerta** | Younger child | Becomes sea god Palaemon |
| **Juno** | Divine orchestrator | Sends Furies to punish family |

### Adaptation Innovations

The Athamas & Ino adaptations introduced formal devices that transfer to Open View:

| Device | A&I Implementation | Open View Inheritance |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **@ Handles** | @ATHAMAS, @INO, @LEARCHUS | Characters as network nodes |
| **Smart Home** | [HOME] network | Surveillance apparatus |
| **"Disconnected"** | Death as network termination | Elimination mechanics |
| **Parallel Reality** | Forest/cliff overlays | Genre-specific realities |
| **Divine Email** | Juno emails Furies | Algorithmic judgment |

### Character Mapping

```
MYTH              ADAPTATION        OPEN VIEW         AUTOBIOGRAPHY
Athamas       →   @ATHAMAS      →   Dad/Father    →   Father
Ino           →   @INO          →   Mom/Mother    →   Mother
Learchus      →   @LEARCHUS     →   Sis/Beth      →   Sister
Melicerta     →   @MELICERTA    →   Son/Rok       →   Little Brother
Juno/Furies   →   @JUNO/@FURY   →   Black Box     →   "The Pattern"
```

### The Core Transformation

All three layers address the same structural question:

> **"What do you see when you're forced to watch yourself?"**

- **Myth:** Athamas sees himself in the cub's face at the moment of destruction
- **Autobiography:** Children finally see the "running away" pattern that was always there
- **Open View:** Family watches their surveillance footage—genre as forced perception

### The Liberation Arc

| Stage | Myth | Autobiography | Open View |
|-------|------|---------------|-----------|
| **Prison** | Madness imposed | Children's ignorance | Genre assigned |
| **Costume** | Recognition | "Apparently frequently" revealed | Genre recognized |
| **Tool** | ??? (myth fails) | ??? (processing) | Genre chosen |
| **Freedom** | Apotheosis (Ino/Melicerta) | ??? | Genre transcended |
