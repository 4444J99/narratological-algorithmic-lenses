# Genre Multiplicity Extension
## Diagnostic Supplement for All Protocol Worksheets

> This extension adds genre-awareness diagnostics to the Fleabag, Curb, and South Park protocols. Apply after completing the primary worksheet when analyzing works that employ **character-specific genre registers** or **scene-level genre shifting**.

---

## 0. Core Principle

**Genre is costume, not body.** Characters can inhabit different genre registers while sharing underlying structural architecture. The collision of genres becomes a narrative engine in itself.

```
GENRE_MULTIPLICITY_AXIOM:
  Same character + different scene = potential genre shift
  Different characters + same scene = genre collision
  All characters + climax scene = genre resolution (or cacophony)
```

---

## 1. Genre Multiplicity × Fleabag Protocol

### 1.1 Genre as Emotional Armor

In Fleabag, comedy protects from grief. In genre-multiple works, **genre itself becomes armor**:

| Character | "Home" Genre | What It Protects Them From |
|-----------|--------------|---------------------------|
| | | |
| | | |

**Diagnostic Question:** Does each character's genre function as their confession-deflection mechanism?

```
GENRE_AS_DEFLECTION:
  Character confesses within their genre → Safe
  Character forced into another's genre → Vulnerable
  Character's genre fails them → Breakthrough moment
```

### 1.2 Fourth Wall × Genre Awareness

Does the character know what genre they're in?

| Character | Aware of Own Genre? | Aware of Others' Genres? | Implications |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------------------|--------------|
| | YES / NO | YES / NO | |
| | YES / NO | YES / NO | |

**Fleabag Parallel:** Fleabag knows she's performing for us. Do your characters know they're performing their genre?

### 1.3 Genre Shift as Confession

Map moments where a character's genre register shifts:

| Character | Scene | Genre A → Genre B | What Does This Reveal? |
|-----------|-------|-------------------|----------------------|
| | | | |

**Fleabag Test:** Does genre shift function like removing armor? When a melodrama character suddenly speaks in thriller register, is that a confession?

### 1.4 Diagnostic Questions (Fleabag × Genre)

1. Does each character's genre protect them from emotional truth? ____
2. Is there a moment where a character's genre "fails" them? ____
3. Does genre collision create the same intimacy/exposure as direct address? ____
4. When characters share a scene, whose genre "wins"? ____
5. Is there a "caught" moment where a character is exposed outside their genre? ____

---

## 2. Genre Multiplicity × Curb Protocol

### 2.1 Genre Collision as Thread Collision

In Curb, independent storylines collide. In genre-multiple works, **genres themselves collide**:

```
CURB_THREAD_MODEL:
  Thread A ────┐
  Thread B ────┼──→ COLLISION
  Thread C ────┘

GENRE_COLLISION_MODEL:
  Genre A ────┐
  Genre B ────┼──→ COLLISION → Which genre governs the catastrophe?
  Genre C ────┘
```

### 2.2 Genre Violation as Social Contract Violation

Curb exposes unspoken social rules. Genre-multiple works can expose **unspoken genre rules**:

| Genre Rule | Statement | Who Violates? | By Doing What? |
|------------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Melodrama | Emotions are heightened and sincere | | |
| Thriller | Information is currency; withhold it | | |
| Rom-Com | Miscommunication leads to reconciliation | | |
| Satire | Positions are pushed to absurdity | | |

**Diagnostic Question:** When a character violates another character's genre rules, is that the source of conflict?

### 2.3 Genre × Setup/Payoff

Do setups planted in one genre pay off in another?

| Setup | Genre Planted In | Genre Paid Off In | Effect |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|--------|
| | | | |
| | | | |

**Curb Principle:** Maximum comedic payoff when setup and payoff occur in different genres (audience didn't expect cross-genre callback).

### 2.4 Genre × Embarrassment Escalation

Does embarrassment escalate when characters are forced into "wrong" genres?

| Character | Home Genre | Forced Into | Embarrassment Level |
|-----------|------------|-------------|---------------------|
| | | | LOW / MED / HIGH |
| | | | LOW / MED / HIGH |

### 2.5 Diagnostic Questions (Curb × Genre)

1. Do all character genres collide by the climax? ____
2. Are genre violations as mortifying as social violations? ____
3. Do setups in one genre pay off in another? ____
4. Does the catastrophe occur when all genres occupy the same space? ____
5. Is there a "governing genre" for the climax, or does cacophony rule? ____

---

## 3. Genre Multiplicity × South Park Protocol

### 3.1 Genre as Position

In South Park, every position is pushed to absurd extreme. In genre-multiple works, **each genre represents a position**:

| Genre | What Position Does It Represent? | Pushed to Extreme = ? |
|-------|----------------------------------|----------------------|
| Melodrama | Emotions matter, feelings are valid | Emotional paralysis, everything is tragedy |
| Thriller | Trust no one, information is power | Paranoid isolation, unable to act |
| Rom-Com | Love conquers all, miscommunication is cute | Stalking, inability to communicate directly |
| Satire | Everything is absurd, nothing matters | Nihilism, cruelty disguised as commentary |

### 3.2 Both Genres Wrong Test

South Park satirizes all positions. Does your work satirize all genres?

| Genre | What's True About It? | What's Ridiculous About It? | Satirized in Draft? |
|-------|----------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|
| | | | YES / NO |
| | | | YES / NO |
| | | | YES / NO |

**South Park Test:** If only one genre is mocked, you're not genre-fluid—you're genre-biased.

### 3.3 Genre × Thematic Clarity

Each genre should comment on the central theme differently:

| Theme: | ____________________________________________ |
|--------|----------------------------------------------|
| How Melodrama addresses it: | |
| How Thriller addresses it: | |
| How Satire addresses it: | |
| How their collision addresses it: | |

### 3.4 THEREFORE/BUT Across Genre Boundaries

Do scenes in different genres connect causally?

| Scene A (Genre) | Connector | Scene B (Genre) | Cross-Genre Causality? |
|-----------------|-----------|-----------------|----------------------|
| | THEREFORE / BUT / AND THEN | | YES / NO |
| | THEREFORE / BUT / AND THEN | | YES / NO |

**South Park Standard:** Genre shifts don't excuse AND THEN. Causality must cross genre boundaries.

### 3.5 Diagnostic Questions (South Park × Genre)

1. Does each genre represent a satirizable position? ____
2. Are ALL genres mocked, not just some? ____
3. Does each genre comment on the central theme? ____
4. Is there THEREFORE/BUT causality across genre boundaries? ____
5. What happens when genres collide—synthesis, victory, or mutual destruction? ____

---

## 4. Cross-Protocol Genre Synthesis

### 4.1 The Genre Multiplicity Matrix

Complete after running all three protocol extensions:

| Character | Home Genre | Fleabag: Genre as Armor? | Curb: Genre Collision Point | South Park: Genre as Position |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| | | YES / NO | Scene: | Position: |
| | | YES / NO | Scene: | Position: |
| | | YES / NO | Scene: | Position: |

### 4.2 Triangulation Questions

| Question | Fleabag Answer | Curb Answer | South Park Answer |
|----------|----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| What happens when genres collide? | | | |
| Is there a "governing genre"? | | | |
| Does genre shift = character development? | | | |
| Is genre awareness part of the story? | | | |

### 4.3 The Meta-Genre Question

All three protocols must answer:

**What genre CONTAINS all these genres?**

| Candidate Meta-Genre | How It Contains Others | Evidence in Draft |
|---------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Surveillance Horror | All characters are "watched" performing their genres | |
| Simulation/Performance | All genres are revealed as performances | |
| Absurdist | Genre itself is arbitrary, collision is meaningless | |
| Tragedy | All genres fail; collision destroys everyone | |
| Metafiction | The story knows it contains genres | |

## 5. Integration Checklist

Before completing protocol analysis, verify:

- [ ] Each character's "home genre" identified
- [ ] Genre function (armor/position/thread) mapped for each protocol
- [ ] Genre collision points identified
- [ ] Cross-genre causality verified (no AND THEN across genres)
- [ ] All genres satirized (not just some)
- [ ] Meta-genre container identified or questioned
- [ ] Genre awareness level of characters assessed

## 6. Quick Reference: Genre Multiplicity

### Genre Functions by Protocol

| Protocol | Genre Functions As... |
|----------|----------------------|
| Fleabag | Emotional armor / confession-deflection mechanism |
| Curb | Independent thread that must collide |
| South Park | Position to be pushed to extreme / satirized |

### Key Tests

```
FLEABAG: Does genre shift = exposure/vulnerability?
CURB: Do all genres collide at catastrophe?
SOUTH PARK: Are all genres mocked equally?
```

### Warning Signs

```
✗ One genre dominates (not multiplicity, just that genre)
✗ Genres never collide (parallel, not integrated)
✗ Genre shifts are AND THEN (no causality)
✗ Only "lesser" genres are mocked (bias, not satire)
✗ No meta-genre container (chaos, not architecture)
```
