## Key Findings Summary

### Strengths

1. **Conceptual Integration:** Successfully layers domestic melodrama, dystopian speculation, media satire, and body horror without losing coherence
2. **Structural Recursion:** Cyclical ending (Sis → Auntie) embodies the script's critique of recursive entertainment
3. **Movement IV Excellence:** Death-game sequence demonstrates expert escalation and causal binding (85% BUT/THEREFORE)
4. **Mom's Arc:** Coherent transformation from passive manager to active killer

### Critical Issues

1. **Movement III Sprawl:** Three parallel storylines (~20% of script) with weak causal binding (55%)
2. **Game Activation Arbitrary:** No character action triggers the death-game; feels disconnected
3. **Son's Motivation Opaque:** Conspiracy exists but goals never articulated
4. **Mom/Sis Underdeveloped:** Emotional climax depends on relationship not established

### Priority Revisions

1. **Compress Movement III** — Cut ~200 lines; strengthen binding
2. **Add Game Causal Trigger** — Connect Son's conspiracy to game activation
3. **Clarify Son's Motivation** — One scene articulating purpose
4. **Develop Mom/Sis** — Add authentic connection scene before game

## Quick Reference

### Logline

When a dysfunctional family is trapped in their futuristic smart-home as contestants in a reality-television death game they didn't know they'd entered, Mom must choose between self-sacrifice and survival as the structure of her world—both literal and familial—disintegrates around her.

### Controlling Idea

SURVIVAL is achieved through SACRIFICE, but survival within a system of recursive trauma merely perpetuates that trauma—there is no escape, only transformation into the next iteration's victim or perpetrator.

### Comparable Works

- *Funny Games* (1997/2007) — metafictional home invasion
- *The Platform* (2019) — dystopian survival critique
- *mother!* (2017) — escalating domestic horror
- *Black Mirror: "White Bear"* — punishment as entertainment
- *Parasite* (2019) — class critique with genre fluidity
