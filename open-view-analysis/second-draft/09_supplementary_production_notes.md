## I. Production Viability Assessment

### Budget Tier

**Assessment:** Medium-High ($15-40M)

| Factor | Requirement | Budget Impact |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Locations | Glass house (primary); hotel; restaurants; military facility; beach; various interiors | Moderate |
| Period/Scope | Near-future; contemporary with speculative elements | Moderate |
| VFX Load | Moderate—glass architecture, toxic environment, tank/death effects | Significant |
| Cast Requirements | Ensemble (13 speaking roles in house); leads for family | Moderate |
| Specialized Elements | Practical effects (tank, burns, violence); water/flood finale | Significant |

### Key Production Challenges

1. **Glass House Design**
   - Central set requires custom build or location + extensive modification
   - Must accommodate 13 actors plus crew
   - Needs to feel both domestic and surveillance-ready
   - Flood/destruction sequence requires practical + VFX hybrid

2. **Tank Sequence**
   - NEW SON in growth tank—practical prosthetic or animatronic recommended
   - Death sequence (boiling) requires careful VFX to avoid exploitation feel
   - Emotional horror, not gore

3. **Violence Choreography**
   - Multiple deaths require distinct staging
   - Mom's systematic killings need clarity without gratuitousness
   - Self-harm duel is psychologically intense; requires intimacy coordinator

4. **Flood/Destruction**
   - Final act destruction of house
   - Practical water effects + VFX extension
   - Bodies floating—requires water tank filming

5. **Coda Sequences**
   - Multiple distinct environments (family dinner, kindergarten, WWI trenches)
   - Period elements for Dad's childhood and Son's war loop
   - Could be shot with minimal crew/reduced locations

## II. Cast Breakdown

| Role | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **MOM** | 40s-50s, protagonist; domestic manager → killer | Requires range from suppressed to explosive; physical demands in final act |
| **DAD** | 40s-50s, emotionally absent patriarch | Sexual content; violence; vulnerability; childhood regression in coda |
| **SIS** | 20s, aspiring actress; survivor | Must convey industry exploitation; inherits protagonist in coda |
| **SON** | 20s, military trainee; conspirator | Hidden romantic relationship; suicidal ideation; dies mid-script |
| **LEADER** | 20s, Son's squad commander and lover | Authority presence; romantic chemistry with Son; dies |

### Supporting Cast

| Role | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **AUNTIE** | 40s-50s, Mom's sister | Wavering complicity; judgment; dies |
| **UNCLE** | 40s-50s, Auntie's husband | Comic relief; "dance tickets" fixation; dies |

- Glass walls/windows creating visibility
- Basement with tank room
- Foyer serving as central death-game arena
- Kitchen with cooking functionality
- Multiple bedrooms visible from common areas

## IV. VFX Requirements

### Essential VFX

| Element | Approach | Complexity |
|---------|----------|------------|

| Toxic exterior glow | Environmental effect through windows | Low |
| Tank/growth fluid | Practical tank + VFX enhancement | Moderate |
| NEW SON death (boiling) | VFX over practical prosthetic | High |

### VFX Supervision Notes

- **Tone over spectacle:** VFX should support horror, not overwhelm it
- **NEW SON death:** This is the script's peak horror moment—execution must be precise
- **Flood:** Final image (bodies floating) should be haunting, not chaotic

---

## V. Special Considerations

### Intimacy Coordination

**Required for:**
- Mom/Dad sexual scenes (Lines 1000-1007, 1870-1941)
- Dad/Love hotel scenes
- Son/Leader romantic/intimate scenes
- Self-harm duel (psychological intimacy)
- Dad's childhood assault flashback (requires extreme care)

### Violence Coordination

**Required for:**
- Dad's assault on New Love and Love
- Son/Leader physical fight
- All death-game violence (13 deaths)
- Mom's systematic killings
- Self-harm duel

### Child Actor Considerations

If casting young actors for Dad's childhood flashback:
- Sensitive content (sexual assault)
- Requires careful scripting of what is shown vs. implied
- May benefit from stylization/abstraction
- Alternative: adult actors + de-aging, or implied only

### Content Considerations

**Explicit material includes:**
- Sexual content (multiple scenes)
- Graphic violence (deaths, assault)
- Child in peril (NEW SON; Dad's childhood)
- Self-harm
- Leaked photos references (not shown in script)

**Rating Projection:** R (MPAA) / 18 (BBFC) / equivalent

## VI. Market Positioning

### Primary Market

**Festival Circuit → Limited Theatrical → Premium Streaming**

Comparable trajectory:
- *mother!* (2017): Venice premiere → limited theatrical → streaming
- *The Platform* (2019): Toronto premiere → Netflix
- *Funny Games* (2007): Cannes → limited theatrical → home video

### Target Festivals

| Festival | Fit | Notes |
|----------|-----|-------|
| **Venice** | Strong | History with challenging family dramas |
| **Toronto** | Strong | Midnight Madness or Platform section |
| **Sundance** | Moderate | May be too dark for Park City audiences |
| **Cannes** | Possible | Un Certain Regard or Director's Fortnight |
| **SXSW** | Possible | Midnighters section |

### Streaming Potential

| Platform | Fit | Notes |
|----------|-----|-------|
| **Netflix** | Moderate | Acquiring international provocative content |
| **Hulu** | Moderate | Horror-adjacent programming |
| **MUBI** | Strong | Art cinema positioning |
| **Shudder** | Strong | Horror specialty |
| **Amazon Prime** | Moderate | Less consistent with challenging content |
| **Apple TV+** | Low | Content conservatism |

### Marketing Challenges

1. **Genre confusion:** Is this horror? Drama? Thriller? Satire?
2. **Tonal whiplash:** Marketing must prepare audiences for shifts
3. **No easy hooks:** No stars, no franchise, no clear comparable
4. **Explicit content:** Limits marketing platforms

### Marketing Opportunities

1. **Timely critique:** Surveillance capitalism, reality TV, algorithmic entertainment
2. **Festival buzz:** Strong festival premiere could generate word-of-mouth
3. **Director vision:** Auteur positioning for filmmaker
4. **Critical engagement:** Academic/critical reception could drive discourse
