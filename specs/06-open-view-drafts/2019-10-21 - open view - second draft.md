A series of location shots in order to describe all the scenery and get a sense for how the world looks.

Everyone asleep in their separate rooms.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

MOM, a perfectly healthy blonde Plain Jane in a summer dress, chops carrots in a 50’s styled kitchen (wood cabinets, frilled curtains on the windows, and out-modded appliances). Her butcher knife makes a loud thud against the cutting board each chop. She whistles “The Candy Man Can.” Sun beams illuminate her joyful bouncing hair as it hits the perfect angle from the window.

Mom slices her finger ever so slightly with the knife.

Somewhere a timer rings out. Mom jumps to attention, knocking over something that makes a metal clang when it falls to the floor.

MOM
Oh god damn!

She bends below the counter, rag in hand, and she says:

MOM
(to the alarm)
Stop.

The timer continues to ring out.

MOM
Stop!

The timer cuts out as Mom sops up ice and vodka from a spilled cocktail tumbler.

She dumps the ice into the sink, then finishes the last sip from a martini glass.

FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
The bird’s burning...

MOM
Oh god damn!

Mom runs over to the now smoking oven, fanning the smoke with the soaked towel. She pulls out the bird from the oven, and drops it onto the stovetop with a clank.

MOM
You’re not calling anymore? Or ringing the bell?

Without missing the next measure, Mom mixes another cocktail.

FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
Do I have to? Make two of--

MOM
Shut up.

FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
Wanted to put it out there in case you weren’t thinking.

MOM
You don’t have to call, but it would be nice.

Mom pours the mix into two glasses, then walks over to the dinner table set with four place settings, where AUNTIE has taken a seat at the only chair without a place setting. Mom’s sister looks just like Mom, but her avatar is dressed and done-up entirely different, a bit more upper-class, something like a dressed down Medieval queen.

CUT TO:

INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT

DAD and his “WORK-FRIEND” sit across from one another in a gaudy bamboo booth. A backlit picture of Asian Mountains in the backdrop and a hanging puffer fish light dangles between them. Dad, donning a classed-up Gui, is quite boring looking; his “Work-Friend” is way out of his league.

A waiter walks overs with two Zombie cocktails.

WORK-FRIEND
How strong are these?

DAD
I hope strong enough.

WORK-FRIEND
(giggles)
Strong enough for what?

DAD
(like ‘duh’)
...Strong enough to wipe the day from my memory.

WORK-FRIEND
Just another Thursday. The weekend is right around the corner.

DAD
I’ll wear your--

Dad peeks under the table, pulling up the table cloth. His “Work-Friend” is shocked.

DAD
--heels any day. If you want to trade shoes.

WORK-FRIEND
Oh stop it, Mister Ten-Five-Eight.
(beat)
I’m starting to regret my decision--

DAD
What do you mean?--which decision specifically?

WORK-FRIEND
The Egg Foo Young was a bad rushed choice. The waiter--

DAD
Seemed impatient.

WORK-FRIEND
Yeah, not that. I want to get home and tucked into my pee-jays.

DAD
There’s no rush though is there?

WORK-FRIEND
According to the waiter there is.

DAD
You could have some of my Mongolian beef, of course.

WORK-FRIEND
Vegetarian, Mister Ten-Five-Eight.

DAD
Call me Dad! Please.

WORK-FRIEND
I’m a vegetarian, Dad.

Dad bangs his fist onto the table. Their Zombies shake and spill some of their guts.

DAD
I need to use the bathroom.

Dad leaves the table. 

The “Work-Friend” sucks down her Zombie, and with the last glass clearing suck Dad returns to the table.

CUT TO:

INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM

A group of fifty or so students (all dressed in white jumpsuits) laze about the auditorium. Some cluster in small groups, others sit solo reading/studying from sheets of paper.

One student, SIS (a perfect amalgamation of Mom and Dad, and also appears to be the same age), approaches a small group of three, their legs dangling off the stage.

SIS
I’m looking for someone--

The trio simultaneously howl at her.

Sis laughs at first, but then the laughter shifts to confusion--She then joins in the howling.

One of the trio hops off the stage knocking Sis onto her ass, and then chases her away.

SIS
(sotto voce)
Impressed by your commitment, assholes.

In the last darkened row of the auditorium, the lights blind Sis for a second, but then a darkened arm cuts through the light, waving her over.

She approaches the darkened figure with a bit too much eagerness, nearly sprinting down the aisle. As she draws close, the Figure springs into on-guard stance. He holds a non-existent rapier in his hand.

SIS
My name is--

HAMLET
Stay back ten paces!

SIS
Oh okay. Do you have a copy of your pages?

HAMLET
Shut up, cunt! Tis the discontented winter in which I’ve suffered. When doth spring bloom again for a ghoul such as myself?

SIS
Line?

HAMLET
This is no fight. You’ve raped my mind for too long and I’ve nearly been forever locked in the tomb betwixt your thighs. Your words strike hard and swift like the savage’s machete and I will treat you like the savage who pillaged my spirit from me.

Hamlet lunges at Sis. She steps out of the way and Hamlet stumbles and falls onto his own sword.

HAMLET
My heart. It must wish me...
(cough)
...goodbye before my soul gone forever, snuffed.

Sis holds Hamlet like a newborn baby. Blood seeps from his wound. She draws herself closer to him;

SIS
(whispering)
Line?

Hamlet grabs the back of Sis’ head and draws her in for a death smooch. 

He violently pushes her onto the floor and then her face into the ground.

Suddenly he’s no longer pushing her down, and she looks up to spot him exiting through the back doors.

Sis hops up.

She looks around from the back of the auditorium eager for another partner; the stage lights no longer blurring her vision.

CUT TO:

INT. TRAINING ROOM

A seemingly infinite dark room. Students, dressed in black jumpsuits, sit in seats that form concentric circles spiraling outward. 

SON, another perfect amalgamation of Mom and Dad, eyes glazed over, twists painfully in his seat.

In his eyes light flickers. Explosions.

EXT. OUTER FRONT - NIGHT

A squad of slender metallic jungle cat like androids lunge superhuman like along a desolate war zone. They’re surrounded by electronic debris. Mountains and craters all around. 

An explosion--

Misses The Squad--

One of The Squad falls out of formation.

LEADER (O.S.)
And G-H-Eighteen-Forty-Three said he was taking this one.

SON (O.S.)
I’m the tortoise, mother fucker.

TEACHER (O.S.)
No mother talk, assholes.

A moon-sized ball of energy collides into the planet, ripping out a huge chunk of planet and 

sending most of The Squad into the upper atmosphere. 

A few are obliterated instantly.

A handful of The Squad survives, and drives on around the crater. They all check up on one another, following proper emergency protocol.

.CONTROL ROOM

A few students shake the glaze out of their eyes and come to.

.OUTER FRONT

Two members of The Squad left run up a hill. 

Leader’s bot has a slight hardware malfunction.

Son overtakes Leader.

He clears a high point in the terrain

and dives headlong into an oncoming enemy squad.

The cat-like robot shifts into a drone.

Unloading all of his artillery, spamming all of his reserves.

Though a valiant effort--

Son is shot out of the sky.

.CONTROL ROOM

Son smiles as he awakens. A group of the boys surround him.

CUT TO:

INT. LAW OFFICE

Tall wooden bookcases filled with law books. BURLY ATTORNEY sits behind a fancy desk, a tablet in hand. He scrolls through law code periodically clearing his throat.

Mom sits before him. She’s dressed like a lawyer. She taps a loosened heel on the wooden floor repeatedly, and holds tightly onto a martini glass.

He gazes over at Mom clearly annoyed.

Mom looks around the room. Finishes her drink.

MOM
Where’s the bar?

The Burly Attorney hushes her.

A short mechanical burst of air draws Mom’s attention behind her to see the bar withdrawing into the ground.

BURLY ATTORNEY
Did you want that answer in this century?

MOM
Well...yes, optimistically.

BURLY ATTORNEY
Then stop tapping your heel, ma’am.

Mom taps her heel five more times, then drinks the condensation from her glass.

MOM
Century is almost up.

BURLY ATTORNEY
I’m having trouble understanding the language here.

MOM
How is that possible?

BURLY ATTORNEY
What I mean is I’m having trouble understanding how to best deliver the information to you.

Mom starts heel tapping again.

MOM
Can she or can’t she?

BURLY ATTORNEY
Well--

MOM
Simply--

BURLY ATTORNEY
She can. We need Dad’s permission however. And, of course--

MOM
Frowned upon.

BURLY ATTORNEY
Yes.

MOM
Is there a way around it?

BURLY ATTORNEY
If there was a way around it, wouldn’t I have said so?

CUT TO:

EXT. IDYLLIC BEACH - SUNSET

Dad lounges in a low beach chair. He’s in swim trunks and a half done button-up shirt. He holds a summer cocktail in hand

He digs his feet into the sand as the water buries them.

Stood next to him in butler garb, JEEVES, a youthful butler.

Jeeves also slowly sinks into the sand with the waves.

DAD
You’ll understand when you’re older, my friend. If you don’t have to get older--fuck that...

JEEVES
Yes, sir.

A long, dull silence builds with each consecutive wave. 

Dad sips on his strawberry daiquiri until the obnoxious end.

An inordinate amount of time passes, the sun nearly wiped out.

He laughs gently. Cracking up once and hard--then a burp rises, but he pounds it away with his fist.

That punch might’ve knocked down the burp, but it brings along with it the most serious crying jag.

Dad’s glass falls onto the sand and rolls into the sea, collecting sand as it rolls. The sea fills the cup and swallows it.

Dad’s crying takes a turn for the violent. He rips the umbrella from the sand and throws it like a spear--

It falls into a graceful and beautiful descent.

Dad screams with all his mights.

DAD
When do I get to go on vacation!?

JEEVES
Sir, we have arrived home.

CUT TO:

INT. THEATRE STAGE

A group of three boys try to pin down one girl on stage. As they try and catch her they all sing chant-like harmonies. 

.SCHOOL BATHROOM

Remarkably clean monotone bathroom. Door slides open. Sis busts in and does a quick bathroom sweep.

SIS
Hello?

She locks the door.

SIS
(with all the world’s sincerity)
You know that when I’m talking to you I want you to fucking look at me, right? Not out the window, not at your phone, not the floor or the ceiling--Out with it already, what do you want?! You’re sucking my very soul out!--What do I want? What do I want? Don’t pretend you don’t know what I want and the kids want from you--yeah, I read the book--you are...I don’t know where to begin --Begin be sucking my dick. Remember those days? The legends once told of blowjobs. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Don’t throw that! You you you no no no
(Sis throws herself on the floor, screaming)
Fuck you!--No fuck you!--Fuck me? Yeah fuck you! Fuck you you cold frigid boring frigid bitch

Someone tries to pull on the door. 

Sis hops up and composes herself.

Banging on the door.

.THEATRE STAGE

Sis center stage, blinded by the light.

SIS
(wooden)
You fuck. You fuck. You fuck. I want you to leave me you cunt. You cunt. You fucking cunt. Leave me. Leave me. Leave me. Leave me alone you fucking cunt.
(beat)
Thanks.

A loud sob chokes out from the audience. A few murmurs and giggles quiet down.

The DRAMA TEACHER applauds loudly, a standing ovation. The rest of the crowd resists, but slowly joins the Drama Teacher.

DRAMA TEACHER
Brilliant! Bravo!

CUT TO:

INT. PIZZERIA

All the students in black fatigues take up all the benches in an extraordinarily large dining area. Son sits at the head of the table, Leader next to him.

Everyone ignores the new king.

Son drags his seat closer to Leader, who is currently engaged in a goofy conversation with others

SON
Leader?

Leader hears but ignores.

Son rests his hand on Leader’s shoulder, leaving it there.

Leader turns around, shrugging off Son’s hand.

LEADER
What’s up?

SON
So what’s the plan after this?

LEADER
Everyone’s going home. What? You wanna rub it in my face more?

SON
No. I wanted to see if you wanted to come by my place. Hang for a bit--

LEADER
And rub it in my face.

SON
No, that’s stupid.

LEADER
You happy now?

SON
I just thought we could hang like--

LEADER
Why are you so weird now?

Son withdraws back, recoiling, he knocks over Leader’s drink.

SON
Ah, shit.

LEADER
How are you squad leader?

SON
Fuck off. Let me get you another one.

LEADER
(trying to grab the cup back)
I don’t need you to.

Son dodges the grab.

SON
(with a smile)
That’s why.

Son pushes away from the table to leave the head of the table.

CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN

Mom shakes up another martini near the sink. Takes a sip from a newly poured glass.

MOM
When will you be home?

DAD (O.S.)
I won’t.

MOM
I cooked...
(beat)
Hello?

Mom dumps all the food into the sink,

She turns on the sink disposal grinder and it roars as it chews up all the discarded food.

MOM
Why are you still here?

AUNTIE
Did you or didn’t you?

MOM
You heard him.

AUNTIE
Sis, I heard him alright, but I asked did you or didn’t you?

MOM
I did. Finally.

AUNTIE
You did not.

MOM
I did. And I’m feeling great about it.

AUNTIE
You’re not joking?

MOM
An hour ago you were.

AUNTIE
What about the kids?

MOM
We had this exact conversation--

AUNTIE
A million times.

MOM
This time I meant it.

AUNTIE
This time I didn’t.

MOM
It won’t work without you.

AUNTIE
I know.

MOM
It won’t.

AUNTIE
I know.

CUT TO:

.RIDESHARE/PARKING GARAGE

Dad lounges in the backseat.

JEEVES
Sir, you are home.

DAD
Sorry.

JEEVES
For what, sir?

.SPA/PRIVATE ROOM

Dance music plays. It’s dark and a strobe light/lazer show takes place. Dad’s face down on a massage bed, his face through the hole, and just below him a long straw leading to a cocktail. On the walls around, above, and below him play footage from a concert.

Dad huffs.

The screens shift to an idyllic Japanese country village. Rain drops fall all around, those wooden water filling instruments play.

A read-headed naked model mounts him 

and starts to play with his butt.

Dad flips around;

DAD
Not tonight.

The massage bed transforms into a king-size bed full of animal furs.

The Naked Model produces lubricant in her hand and jacks Dad off.

Dad does his best to relax and try and get into it.

He sits up when he can’t get aroused.

The Naked Model pushes him back down, and feeds him a pill.

Dad spits the pill out.

Dad takes charge, flips her over, and kiss her on the mouth. 

Dad breaks into pieces, sobbing.

Naked Model consoles him.

CUT TO:

.THEATRE/STAGE/WING

Sis exuents stage left from thunderous applause.

Sis doesn’t sense their hate and comes stampeding into the wings. 

She jumps up looking for high-fives, 

but they all move out of the way and she crash lands into some stage equipment causing a huge racket that disturbed the current performers. 

The performer’s in the wings laugh at Sis. They hate this bitch with all of their beings. Amongst them the wrestlers, two singers, one poet, and five actors.

The next performer begins on stage behind them.

POET
Thou find thy self wrapped constant in controversy.

ONE ACTOR
Where’d you pull that shit from?

THE SINGERS
(harmonizing)
Her Assssssssss!

Sis, composure regained, But the other actors shove her on the ground.

The Current Performer exuents into the wings.

CURRENT PERFORMER
What the fuck was that?

And in one fell swoop, they all point to a crumbled Sis.

CUT TO:

.UNDERGROUND TUNNEL/WALKWAY

Son and Leader walk hand-in-hand down a cast underground tunnel. Six feet of glass separates them from all types of visible noxious gasses. 

Every few moments the setting sun blares down upon them. 

Son turns to face Leader and hugs him for one minute. 

Leader eventually hugs him back.

.HOME/FOYER

A warm, Southern style foyer. Family pictures fill the walls.

Son assists Leader (zombie-like) off with his shoes.

Mom enters.

MOM
You just missed a delicious meal.

SON
Mom, this is my best friend, Leader.

MOM
Hello, sweetie, aren’t you cute?

Leader smirks, barely.

SON
He’s shy.

MOM
Listen. You’ll be alright, right? My sweet boy.

SON
What?

MOM
You’re fine.

CUT TO:

.DRAMA TEACHER’S OFFICE

Drama Teacher sits across from Sis.

DRAMA TEACHER
Why did you disturb your peer’s performance?

SIS
It was an accident. I’m sorry.

DRAMA TEACHER
Do you understand the commitment this program asks?

SIS
I do, and I’m--

DRAMA TEACHER
We leave immediately.

SIS
I know.

DRAMA TEACHER
You won’t be back for at least one to one and one half years.

SIS
I know.

CUT TO:

.RIDESHARE

Dad is in the same position as before.

DAD
Listen, I want to go on the longest trip possible. I’ll shake the hand and do the dance with every god damned business any god damn where. Okay. Listen. I need to get out of here.

BOSS (O.S.)
Who’d you kill?

DAD
It’s not like that.

BOSS (O.S.)
Who’d you fuck?

DAD
Can you or can’t you help?

CUT TO:

.HOME/FOYER

The boys walk up a flight of stairs, 

Leaving Mom behind. Mom collects herself.

Then walks over to a large family portrait to gaze upon it. The  painting fades away,

And a door behind it slides open.

.BASEMENT/NURSERY

The makings of a clean, white, clinical medical center. At center stage, a floor-to-ceiling tank, and inside a nearly adult and fully formed human.

Mom enters.

Mom focuses on the newborn son’s family montage:

-- Dad teaches him how to shave 
-- they share a beach day
-- the new son almost swallowed by the waves, but Son saves him
-- Son and Sis and New Son ‘play’ school together
-- they all jump on a trampoline
-- Mom holds an infant new Son on her bare belly

She throws herself at the feet of the unborn child and sobs.

The loudest thunder you ever heard * 1,000 shuts down the electricity. 

We see we’re in a large rectangular glass complex.

EXT. HOME - NIGHT

Sis practices her new lines.

Son and Leader are in a brawl (Son’s winning).

Dad’s asleep on the couch.

Mom sobs in the basement. 

We see all of this, pulling out, but we see the storm of the century, tsunamis, hail, etc. beat upon the house.

A large crack is revealed in a moment of moonlight.

In Son’s room: explosive content.

Electricity pops back on.

We see a world of cylindrical bright shinning columns from sea too sky. There is no outside anymore.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. NURSERY

Mom sleeps up curled around the feet of the grow tank. No longer surrounded by medical clarity and cleanliness, but surrounded by the warmth of a child’s nursery. On the walls educational cartoons play.

Mom wakes up in some tall grass. The sun shines brightly from the east. Mom shades her eyes from the sun and breathes in a sigh of relief or despair. 

She places her palm against the glass tank.

The unborn son’s eyes flutter, shocking Mom, she recoils.

DAD (O.S.)
Honey, breakfast is ready!

A spear of guilt hits Mom directly in the gut. She doubles over with shame and pain.

DAD (O.S.)
Mom! You hear?

MOM
I’m coming.

Mom places her ear against the glass tank and listens to the boy’s subtle heartbeat.

.FOYER

Mom appears from behind the family portrait, passing through it.

Son runs into the room, energized and excited; he spots Mom--

SON
(as he’s exiting)
Morning! Hope you’re hungry.

Mom advances toward the kitchen. Sis comes up behind her, and interlopes the crook of their arms together. Sis leads them to the kitchen.

SIS
You were up early.

MOM
Not as early as all of you apparently.

SIS
What do you mean?

MOM
I fell asleep in the nursery.

SIS
Again?

MOM
Yeah.

SIS
Are you doing okay?

.KITCHEN

The kitchen that was once 50s style is now hyper modern. Dad flips a pancake in a pan. Son waits attentively for his serving of breakfast. They both light up with joy as Mom enters.

Everyone settles around the kitchen table.

DAD
Blueberry.

SIS
Just like you like.

Mom cries.

Dad quickly consoles her. He wraps her in a warm embrace and plants a soothing kiss on her forehead.

DAD
There there. Let’s eat up and have a nice day. Son suggested boating, but we don’t need another sea sickness incident.

SON
It won’t happen--

DAD
Like I said. Let’s have a nice day, you hear?

SON
Sis, plate us up.

SIS
Do it yourself.

DAD
Hey!

Mom gets up and within a second returns with plates filled with pancakes already buttered and syrup drizzled on top along with utensils and glasses of milk (except one glass of juice for Dad).

Mom sits back down, wipes her eyes and settles into a lovely breakfast. She tries her best to pull the guilt spear out because after all, what even really happened?

MOM
So where did we decide to go?

DAD
As I was saying.
(takes a bit of food)
Son suggested boating. Sis suggested rock climbing. I compromised and said beach.

MOM
That sounds nice.

DISSOLVE TO:

.NORTHERN CALIFORNIAN BEACH

Mom, Dad, Sis, and Son (all dressed in different styled bathing suits) descend down a narrow pebble path towards the beach.

DISSOLVE TO:

.BEACH

Mom struggles to open the umbrella.

Son, about to take off with his water board, halts to help Mom.

Dad and Sis lay out the towels.

DISSOLVE TO:

Mom and Dad sitting together. The kids play in the surf.

MOM
Could you get my back?

DAD
Why of course.

Dad does as asked. He kisses her neck.

They lay back on cuddle on the towels.

MOM
Can you see the kids?

DAD
They’re fine.

MOM
Goddammit.

Mom rolls around to better see the kids.

MOM
Why can’t you--

DAD
I can and could see them.

MOM
Sorry...
(original position resumed)
I need to tell you something.

DAD
Let’s not talk about that right now.
(beat)
Wanna go to our place tonight?

MOM
Why?

DAD
Why not?

MOM
Listen, I need to get this out.

DAD
Let’s not talk about this.

MOM
I can’t go on without talking about it.

DAD
Okay.

MOM
I...
(beat)
I...well...
(beat)
I can’t say it.

Beat.

DAD
The question still stands?

MOM
What?

DAD
After the beach, we got home, freshen up, and go to our place?

CUT TO:

.BEDROOM

Mom and Dad fuck. Completely naked. Time spending to get it all right. No one is in a rush.

Mom has an orgasm.

Dad hops off and into the shower.

CUT TO:

.CHINESE RESTAURANT

The doors open, Dad holds the door for Mom and leads her to their reserved table. A group of restaurant workers await them, tending to them like royalty.

But the sight of Auntie and UNCLE distract them. They’re sidelined, and make a pitstop at Auntie’s table.

AUNTIE
Fancy seeing you two love birds out.

MOM
(quiet greetings)
Sis. Uncle.

UNCLE
Hello, you two!

AUNTIE
Sit. Have a Zombie!

UNCLE
Oh, yes please.

DAD
It’s date night tonight. Though we’d love to.

UNCLE
Of course, of course. We understand.

AUNTIE
Fine! Well then I’m off to run to the bathroom.

Auntie gets up, and starts off;

AUNTIE
Can’t a sister get some company?

Mom looks to Dad, then huffs and walks off with Auntie.

.BATHROOM

Mom and Auntie was their hands.

MOM
Out with it already. What do you want?

AUNTIE
Wow.

MOM
Well after last night--

AUNTIE
Last night? Did I miss something? You always like to play these games of barely saying anything and then getting pissed off when no one knows what the fuck you’re talking about.

MOM
What do you want, Sis?!

AUNTIE
What happened last night?

MOM
Honestly, I don’t know that anything happened last night.

AUNTIE
You’re annoying.

MOM
What. Do. You. Want.

AUNTIE
To do the fucking favor you asked of me, bitch. And a big fucking favor it is.

.BACK AT MOM AND DAD’S TABLE

Mom and Dad’s food arrives. Dad divvies up some onto Mom and his plate.

Mom plays with her food.

DAD
Should we send it back? Get something different?

The Zombies arrive.

MOM
I was thirsty.

Mom grabs for her drink, then to take a quick gulp--

DAD
A quick toast! Or rather, a proposal--

Mom gulps her Zombie.

Dad cheers his glass to Mom’s as she sips.

DAD
Let’s have another baby.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. AIRPORT

Dad lies folded in on himself in a chair waiting for his flight.

Dad’s POV: He watches people at the airport while also swiping on woman in a dating app reflecting in his right eye (splits the screen between reality and the application).

.AIRPORT BATHROOM

Dad masturbates vigorously in a handicap stall.

He can’t ejaculate.

He beats the wall and kicks the toilet bowl.

.AIRPORT

Dad exits the bathroom.

“Work-Friend” walks around looking befuddled.

They crash into one another. And just as they’re about to turn around and yell at one another--

Dad ignites with joy! He sweeps his arm into the air to try and grab her attention.

DAD
Love!

LOVE turns to the voice she just heard and the same joy that washed over Dad now washes over her.

They leap toward one another, and as they’re about to embrace Dad’s rolling luggage knocks into Love’s knee. She laughs it off because she is the coolest girl in the world.

Dad and Love hug tightly, wrapping around one another as the hustle and bustle of the international airport pushes and pulls them like in a rock concert mosh pit.

Dad lets go and takes her hand leading her through the masses. They move fish-like in the opposite direction of everyone else.

.AIRPLANE

Dad shoves Love’s luggage in the overhead. She takes her seat, he plants a kiss on her, then moves back up to first class, but turns back for an even longer kiss.

PASSENGER
‘Scuse me.

DISSOLVE TO:

Dad takes a cautious peek back at Love, only quickly glancing. She doesn’t see him, she’s engaged in pleasantries with someone else who he can’t see.

He turns back in his seat, and does his best not to stew.

We hear Love’s laugh. So does Dad. Very much so indeed. He hops out of his seat and heads toward the back of the transport.

Love’s chatting with another girl. She gets excited when she sees Dad.

LOVE
What do you think you’re doing back here, mister?

DAD
(snapping, ‘oh shucks’)
First class bathrooms are full.

.HOTEL HALLWAY

Dad and Love walk down the hall. Dad handles both luggages.

DAD
What’s the number again?

LOVE
We’re not going to your room?

DAD
Shouldn’t we drop your stuff of first?

LOVE
(Wounded)
Oh. Okay.
(beat)
Right here--

CUT TO:

.FANCY HOTEL RESTAURANT

Dad, Love, and business associates sit around a table bullshitting.

CUT TO:

.HOTEL ROOM

Dad and Love make out. 

Love tries to advance the make out to sex. Dad’s hesitant, he tries to evade. He can’t get hard because he is a fucking loser, or, at least he, and few other people, think so.

Dad throws a hissy fit on the bed.

Dad and Love cuddle as the electronic blinds cut out a vibrant under water city behind them until they’re engulfed in total darkness.

EXT. HOTEL POOL - MORNING

Love takes a lovely dive into the pool.

Dad sits in a lunge chair drinking a Pina Colada adorned with a huge chunk of pineapple.

Love finished her lap in the pool, then comes up to the edge of the pool near Dad to bare her smile and soul to this hopeless man.

He only smiles back and take a nice sip of his cocktail.

DAD
Want me to bring you your drink?

LOVE
Yes please!

Dad does just that. After her sip she gives him a wet kiss, which makes him cringe. He wipes away the spit from his mouth.

As Dad goes from a low crouch to standing tall, he spots a woman getting out of the pool on the other end. 

When she towels off we notice, and he does too, that she looks just like Love but with different hair in that she looks like Mom (but isn’t Mom). [This new bird we spot resembles Mom]

Dad quickly finishes his drink. Love hops out of the pool.

DAD
(pointing to his empty glass)
Bathroom and bar break.

He heads toward the Mom Clone.

LOVE
Wrong way.

Dad halfway there, shrugs innocently, and keeps on in the “wrong” way.

He stares down at the now tanning Mom Clone as he passes her, slowing down near her.

.BATHROOM

Dad masturbating.

He comes like a monster.

BATHROOM PATRON (O.S.)
I’ll have what he’s having.

.HOTEL ROOM

Dad lies on the bed, liquor neat on his belly. He watches tv on all the screens in the room. Love showers in the bathroom.

A knock at the door.

DAD
Wrong room!

Another knock.

DAD
Wrong room!

Knock knock. Whisper whisper.

LOVE (O.S.)
Are you going to get the door!?

Dad gets up in a huff.

He opens the door. It’s Clone Mom, or, NEW LOVE.

DAD
Who are you?

NEW LOVE
The ogled.

Dad laughs.

DAD
No you don’t understand. You look like my wife,

LOVE (O.S.)
Who is it?

DAD
How did you find our room?

New Love lays a big one on Dad. They stumble into the hallway, the door closing behind them.

They start to go at it right there on the floor.

Dad can’t get it up.

NEW LOVE
Come on.

DAD
I’m trying!

ON LOOKER
I’d say get a room, but--

NEW LOVE
What a loser.

Dad punches her in the face.

Love comes from behind to intercept.

Dad wildly swings back, hitting Love too. He’s on top of her and he starts to beat her.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. HOME

Dad sits on the couch with a broken and beaten face. Mom holds his hand. Dad starts to cry.

DAD
I hate this. I hate this. I hate this. I hate this. I hate this. I hate this. I hate this. I hate this. I hate this.

Mom hushes him and holds his head in her lap.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

.PRESS CIRCUIT INTERVIEW

Sis sits across from a beautiful interviewer. On the background behind them clips play from Sis’s successful acting career. The relations between Sis and the interviewer is familiar and friendly. The clips are cut to a fun pop instrumental.

NYM
I don’t know how best to say this without tearing up.
(she fans her wetted eyes)
You’ve touched billions of young woman everywhere.

SIS
(faux modesty shifts into a giggle)
True.

NYM
We asked those billions of fans to submit questions and the one that wins by a landslide is: “when the photos leaked, what was your reaction?”

Sis looks to her camera smiling.

NYM
Were you ashamed? Embarrassed--

SIS
Would you be embarrassed to have my body?

NYM
It’s not just that.

SIS
It’s not.

NYM
The positions were compromising.

SIS
Go on.

The background footage shifts to a cross dissolving montage of Sis sucking dick, getting came on, etc. Porn star shit.

SIS
I give the fans what they want.

A round of uproarious applause.

Sis reaches over and starts making out with Nym.

QUICK CUT TO:

Sis and Nym in their composed original positions.

NYM
What’s next for you, Sis?

Sis smirks like a devil.

DISSOLVE TO:

.FACETIME WITH AGENT

Sis looks directly at the Agent/camera.

AGENT (O.S.)
So there’s a lot here you need to sort through the damn thing and we’ll build a schedule. You’ve been putting this off for too long now and I’m getting pissed.

SIS
I did sort through the damn thing. They’re the same shit.

AGENT
You know what you’re good at. Why is that bad?

SIS
Because it’s fucking boooooring!

AGENT
What do you imagine is next for you, Sis?

SIS
Get me auditions for something other than frigid mom or depressed daughter.

AGENT
Then show more range. Find something viral.

SIS
The photos were nothing?

AGENT
Not yet anyhow.

SIS
Fuck you!

AGENT
Fuck you. I want to get paid too.

SIS
Fuck you.

AGENT
Fuck you.

SIS
Fuck you!

Sis pulls out her wet pussy. They continue to chant “fuck you.”

DISSOLVE TO:

.CASTING COUCH

Sis faces an audience of a chorus of Suits/the camera. Behind her (on the entirety of the wall) a livened of what she is currently doing.

SUITS (O.S.)
Welcome, Sis! So glad you can make it. We’re super excited to give you the opportunity to read for us.
(beat)
Annnnd whenever you’re ready.

Sis clears her throat. Straightens her spine up. Dons the grandest smile, and--

Forgets her line. Chokes up.

But they come back;

SIS
Not that it’s any of your business, hot stuff--but i’ve worked this jumbo yacht for three years in a row. So you might be first mate, but me--I got three years on you.

SUITS (O.S.)
What else you got on me, baby?

SIS
I got my eyes on you too.

Suits clap. Sis bows her head.

SUITS (O.S.)
Thank you for coming in. You’ll hear from us if we think it’s a match.

Sis stands up to go.

SUITS (O.S.)
But before you go.

Sis halts.

SUITS (O.S.)
Can you humor us with your overbearing mom bit.

SIS
Oh...ha.

Sis hesitates. She almost leaves, but then returns to the center frame, her head is cut off by the camera.

Sis repeats her first performance as if it was her thousandth time doing it.

DISSOLVE TO:

.CAMP COUNSELOR’S BUNK ROOM

Door opens. Sis enters.

ACTRESS (O.S.)
I got three years on you.

ACTOR
What else you got on me?

ACTRESS
My eyes. Duh.

Sis enters the scene. Actor and Actress make out.

SIS
Hey! What’s going on here!

ACTRESS
Mind your business!

ACTOR
Fucking tight ass.

ACTRESS
Not really--ha.

SIS
I’m reporting this. It’s not right.

ACTRESS
Frigid bitch.

SIS
I’m not frigid, bitch! You’re harassing me. And counselor’s can’t fraternize.

DISSOLVE TO:

Actor and Actress fucking.

Sis spanks the Actor with nine tails.

Sis writes them up.

SIS
Okay, both of you are in trouble for real.

Sis shoves her fist in the Actor’s anus. He comes like a monster.

CUT TO:

.CASTING COUCH

Same casting couch setup as before.

SIS
Wrap it up, kids! I said it was bedtime an hour ago and I went into the bathroom and what did I find?

SUITS (O.S.)
I doooon’t know.

SIS
Dry toothbrushes.

Suits give a round of applause for a minute straight.

SUITS (O.S.)
Us oh us, how delightful you’ll be in this role. How absolutely delightful.

SIS
I thought I was reading for the the part of ADHD Bipolar girl.

SUITS (O.S.)
Your strength is knowing what you’re good at and sticking to it.

SIS
Thanks for letting me read. 

SUITS (O.S.)
Before you go. For old time’s sake.

Sis quickly dives into Shakespearean monologue;

SIS
What, have I scaped love-letters in the holiday time of my beauty, and am I now a subject for them? Let me see.
(holds up palm)
Ask me no reason why I love you; for though love use reason for his physicians, he admits him not for his counsellor. You are not young, no more am I; go to then, there’s sympathy: You are merry, so am I.

Sis erupts in laughter.

Two black shaped shadows carry her off screen.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

.HOME/SON’S BEDROOM

Son’s asleep, the bum that he is--but he’s asleep with love, a deep deep slumber.

An arm wraps around him, a bare and defined arm. Then Leader’s face pops up, nuzzling Son’s neck violently. He wants to eat him alive, but decides to kiss him instead.

Son, still feigning sleep, slips the crook of his arm under Leader, flips and reverse pins him. He grinds his morning erection into his friends’ behind.

They fight, and they wrestle, and claw at each other’s flesh.

.TRAIN/SUBWAY

Son and Leader sit next tone another on the train. They don’t hold hands, but they are touching covertly. Now this isn’t because love between two men is frowned upon, this is because the beginning taboos of relationships are fucking fun.

LEADER
I could barely contain myself.

SON
Me neither. I love how you smell.

LEADER
Thanks. Soon they will all be 
(whispers)
evaporated.

SON
Huh?

LEADER
Where’s your brain?

SON
I don’t know.

LEADER
Spend the night at my house tonight.

SON
Okay. Will your parents be okay with--

LEADER
Were yours?

SON
Who cares?

LEADER
Exactly.

Leader takes Son’s hand and leads him off the train.

.PIZZERIA

Leader leads Son into the pizzeria by hand.

Leader, crowned squad leader once more, sits upon his throne amongst his loyal followers who could not and would not accept Son as squad leader, re-embrace Leader with joy. 

The party lacking before is in full force, Leader the life of the party makes some type of large and grande gesture as he welcomes back the crown. As was, as always will be.

But Son now feels at home being Leader’s right hand boy (not man), sat next to Leader, and watches in awe as Leader takes his power away from him, and it is a subtle and painless extraction. Son doesn’t fight his submissions, he eats it up, and grins as the shit enters his mouth.

DISSOLVE TO:

.LEADER’S KITCHEN

Son sat amongst familial festivities and glorious celebration all in service of Leader. A snapshot in the family album. Leader’s dad slaps his son “good job” on the back.

Leader’s parents for Son and Leader together for a family snapshot. Son wraps his submissive arm around Leader’s shoulder.

DISSOLVE TO:

.LEADER’S BEDROOM

Crossfade from the photo, fall into each other, nude. 

Twirling in sheets, they dance, enticing one another, move forward, retreat, move forward, and retreat. Spinning around in the sheets.

They fall into multiple positions. Sometimes Leader pins Son, but more often Son pins Leader.

They kiss. Finally.  

DISSOLVE TO:

Son and Leader wrestling nude. The walls cloud in time-lapse.

DISSOLVE TO:

Son, rubber gloved, handles explosive material. Leader helps (also rubber gloved).

A fat silence.

Son’s struggling with something. He works up the nerve to talk;

SON
So let me just run you through it.

LEADER
I thought we put em at all the entrances.

SON
Yeah, for beginners.

LEADER
Duh.

SON
I got enough here--

LEADER
To kill a...
(beat)
what you say again?

SON
Enough power to wipe out a whole planet.

LEADER
We barely have enough for the entrances. For my house and yours. And--

They get back to their very serious work. The answers to most questions are better left unasked (but if asked), unsaid at this point in their mission.

SON
Not the entrances.

LEADER
Then where? What’s your bright idea?

SON
At the heart of the thing.

Son shoves his finger into Leader’s chest. The explosive material burns through his shirt, past his skin and breastplate and into the heart, and into the soul of his compatriot.


LEADER
What if through the heart 
(he places his dirty finger to Son’s chest)
we’re unable to reach the brain.

SON
There’s nobody with out a heart.

LEADER
The brain can still keep going.

Son knocks Leader’s finger away from his chest.

.PIZZERIA

Son sits two seats away from leader. New festivities celebrate the New Number Two. 

Son smiles through a frown.

Son watches Leader converse with Number Two.

DISSOLVE TO:

Son exits, leading the first group of exiters.

INT. STREET/TUNNEL

Son walks the opposite direction of the black-fatigued trainees.

Leader appears behind him. He grabs his hand, and pulls him in the opposite direction.

Son slips his hand free, then continues on his trek.

Leader attempts the same move--

But Son is steadfast in his direction. 

Leader finally joins him.

LEADER
Where do you think you’re going?

SON
Home.

LEADER
Wrong direction.

SON
Nope. I’m walking in the right direction. You’re walking in the wrong direction.

LEADER
What’s the problem?

SON
Nothing.

LEADER
Then come home.

SON
I’m going home!

LEADER
Wrong way.

Son halts. Leader, leading the way now, keeps going. Son starts up again, catching up.

Beat.

LEADER
So we’re going to your house then?

SON
I am.

LEADER
What’s the problem?

SON
I gotta go home and you gotta go home too.

LEADER
Do you think your parents are worried?

SON
This is all a mistake.

LEADER
Who cares.

SON
I care.

LEADER
You said that.

SON
What?

LEADER
Who cares.

SON
This is my thing. You and Judas should go do your own thing now.

LEADER
What?

SON
You heard me.

LEADER
I heard what you said. I just don’t like it.

Son pounces on Leader. This tunnel, of once romance, is of now violence. Son, legs and arms wrapped around Leader, Leader holds the weight swaying back and forth, 

Crashing into pedestrians.

The storm surrounding them turns to harsh hail. Large chunks of ice crash against the six-foot thick glass.

Leader flips Son off of him and onto the ground, and pins him.

LEADER
In public?

SON
(frustrated beyond all belief)
Shut up!

Son reverses the pin.

SON
(spittle)
I told you once now this is my fucking thing. Go get your own thing.

Leader reverses the pin. He shoves an elbow into Son’s throat. 

Son becomes a feral cat, clawing and scratching at Leader, but this is an inescapable pin.

Leader’s elbow slowly chokes the life from Son’s throat.

Son tries for Leader’s eyes, his ears, but Leader is simply a superior being in this moment.

Son claws the steel floors. 

Around them the hail lets through a moment of sunlight. Then a giant wave comes crashing down.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

.MOM AND DAD’S BEDROOM - MORNING

Mom and Dad, both in the midst of nightmares, sleep on separate sides of the bed. About as far apart away as you can sleep from someone. They’re both wrapped in different sheets; Dad a light bed sheet and Mom a heavy comforter. 

They’re in the middle of an arctic landscape. A vast vista of sprawling snow frozen hills. In the far background a single mountain comes to a single pyramid like peek.

Mom rolls closer to the middle of the bed.

Dad rolls closer, he wraps an arm over Mom.

All the while “asleep,” Mom and Dad continue to cuddle up next to one another, closer and closer until Dad forms the big spoon to Mom’s little spoon.

Mom rubs her rump against Dad, who moans. But while sleeping the moan sounds sad and mournful. Mom smirks, eyes shut.

This continues until Dad slips into Mom. She sucks in air with a quick gasp. Dad’s crook of his arm wraps around her throat.

Mom wakes up. And shocked, she starts to try and stop Dad. Pounding her tiny fists into him.

Dad wakes up. Still going. Then stops.

The arctic wasteland shifts to an ultra modern white glass walled bedroom.

They look at each other in disbelief for a beat--

Then ricochet off one another to their respective sides of the bed.

DAD
What the hell were you doing to me?

MOM
What the fuck were you doing to me?

DAD
You were holding me.

MOM
You said you wanted another--

DAD
Baby.

MOM
Right.

DAD
What the hell...

The doorbell rings.

MOM
...is going on?

HOUSE (O.S.)
Auntie and Uncle have dropped by.

DAD
Why is she here?

MOM
I don’t know.

DAD
You know.

MOM
I don’t.

DAD
You must.

They both get dressed.

Down the hall

Down the stairs into the 

.FOYER

Auntie and Uncle enter. They’re dressed to the nines. ‘

Mom and Dad meet them by the front door, dressed in robes (something digital), and carrying cocktails, which they disperse properly.

DAD
(holding a cheers up)
Uncle.

UNCLE
Brother, sister
(gulp)

DAD
Auntie.

AUNTIE
Brother.

MOM
Uncle.

UNCLE
Mom.

MOM
Sis.

AUNTIE
Yes.

They all finish they cocktails. Jazz vocal music slowly fades in.

DAD
Where are you off to tonight? P.S. you look lovely Auntie.

UNCLE
Good question.

AUNTIE
We’re going to the dance. The dance. How many time must I say it?

UNCLE
We’re going to the dance, Dad. You heard her.

MOM
Aren’t you going to be late?

The music gets louder.

Dad collects everyone’s cocktail glasses and walks on over to the bar in the far corner of the room. He starts another round of drinks. Dialogue barely audible;

MOM (O.S.)
What brings you by?

Uncle joins dad by the bar.

AUNTIE (O.S.)
Don’t be dumb.

UNCLE
(to Dad)
Woman.

DAD
(not meaning it)
Give my wife your ticket and we’ll go out.

MOM (O.S.)
I know why. But why?!

AUNTIE (O.S.)
Because I changed my mind.

The music lowers.

AUNTIE (O.S.)
(lower)
Ahem. We changed our minds.

Dad hands Uncle his cocktail. They rejoin the ladies. 

DAD
Changed your minds about?

Dad hands the girls their drinks.

CUT TO:

.BASEMENT/NURSERY

New Son dreams about sharks.

Dinosaurs fighting.

O.S. muffled yelling. The basement door slides open. Mom and Dad run down the stairs, their argument drawing closer until they enter the frame and silhouette the grow tank.

DAD (O.S.)
You did what?!

MOM (O.S.)
We can still get out of it.

DAD
We.

MOM
Me. I could get out of it.

DAD
And you were just gonna give him to your sister.

MOM
We were supposed to talk about it yesterday at dinner. Or tonight.

DAD
What?

MOM
What day is it?

DAD
Never mind what day it was or is. Do you have the authority to make that decision without me? A lawyer said this?

MOM
Not necessarily. But possibly.

Dad puts his palm onto his son’s tank. 

New Son’s dream changes: as a baby, Dad rocks him in his arms. 

MOM
You didn’t come to dinner again. And neither did the kids. Again.

DAD
He’s mine too.

MOM
(crying)
I know.

Mom places her palm on the tank, falling to the floor, dragging her palm along the glass. 

New Son’s dream changes: Mom and Dad in bed. Dad has his head resting on a pregnant bump. They’re giggling as Dad sings, forgetting the lyrics, to some old lullaby.

DAD
Why are you the one crying? You wanted this.

Doorbell rings.

HOUSE (O.S.)
Officers of the law have arrived.

They look at each other in amazement. 

Then take a few steps back out of frame.

New Son’s dream changes: he’s running along a paved road at night, there’s headlights behind him, chasing him.

.FOYER

Leader’s parents (MISTER LEADER and MISSUS LEADER), Two officers (BOSS and SIDEKICK), Auntie, Uncle, and Mom congregate in the foyer.

Dad appears, serving everyone a drink from a waiter tray.

DAD
Honey, we need a butler. Officers, nice to meet you.

MOM
What the hell is going on?

MISSUS LEADER
What the fuck is going is more like it?!

AUNTIE
(finishes her drink)
We were just leaving.

Auntie and Uncle approach the door. It don’t budge.

AUNTIE
We were just leaving--

HOME (O.S.)
No you were not.

Music turns up louder.

BOSS
Where’s the boy?

MOM
What boy?

MISSUS LEADER
Which boy?

BOSS
Leader _and_ your Son, third in command.

DAD
Boyssss?

SIDEKICK
(throws beer across the room)
We need to see the boys and we need to see them now!

BOSS
(to Sidekick)
Settle down and clean that up.
(to Mom)
Sorry ma’am.

UNCLE
We were _just_ stopping by so can we _just_ leave?

BOSS
Everyone stay put.

UNCLE
But we have expensive--very--tickets to the dance.

SIDEKICK
You heard him!

BOSS
No one can leave until the crime is rectified.

UNCLE
We’re gonna need another drink.

BOSS
You won’t be late to your dance.

UNCLE
Well I hope not.

.HALLWAY - OUTSIDE SON’S DOOR

Boss, Mom, and Leader’s parents stand in front of Son’s door.

MOM
Son, you in there?

Beat.

Boss waves his handheld near the door and it opens.

.SON’S ROOM

Son asleep on his bed.

As they all file into his jungle-themed room, an ape yells. And son wakes up in a panic.

MISSUS LEADER
Where is my son?

MISTER LEADER
Where is her son?

MOM
What’s going on?

SON
I don’t know what they’re talking about.

BOSS
Where is your Leader? We know he is in the building.

Son moves some pillows and blankets on his vast jungle bed. He reveals Leader, asleep and naked.

MISTER LEADER
There’s her boy.

MISSUS LEADER
There’s my boy.

Son pushes on Leader waking him slowly. 

Groggily he sits up, but then falls back down. He giggles sloppily, and rolls lazily around on the bed.

BOSS
What did you do to their son?!

MISTER LEADER
What did you do to her son?!

MISSUS LEADER
What did you do to my son?!

 Beat.

Boss grabs Son and tosses him up against the wall.

MOM
Don’t hurt him!...Boys will be boys, you know.

SON
Jeez, he’s high. I didn’t do anything to him.

MISTER LEADER
Her son does not do drugs.

MISSUS LEADER
No. And he doesn’t stay out all night without tell his mother either.

Boss released Son to the ground.

Missus Leader goes to Leader on the bed. Mom goes to Son on the floor.

MOMS CHORUS
Are you alright? Hello! Answer your mother when she talks to you

SONS CHORUS
Better than alright, Mom. Great. Swell.

The Sons laugh.

MOMS CHORUS
Why are you laughing?

Another police alarm.

The Sons cry. Leader’s mom pulls him closer.

HOME (O.S.)
Two officers of the law have arrived with Sis in tow.

Mom gets up from the floor.

MOM
What the hell is going on?

CUT TO:

.FOYER

Boss, Sidekick, Mom, Dad, Leader’s parents, Leader (leaning just barely on his parents), Auntie, Uncle, and now joined by Sis and two more officers (SLIME and TOUGH). Son and Sis are both in handcuffs.

MOM
What the--

DAD
Fuck is going on?!

SLIME
Your daughter has been red flagged. We need to search the premises for--

UNCLE
Can we go now?

BOSS
No.

UNCLE
But they got their son.

BOSS
A new crime is suspected while you were here--so the overlap.

UNCLE
Trapped.

BOSS
Correct.

UNCLE
By you!

AUNTIE
We have very--

SIDEKICK
Very expensive tickets.

TOUGH
And we have a hostile situation here with potential firearms and or explosives.

SIS
Huh?!

Sis backs away in disbelief. She falls into hugging her knees. Pantomimes a cry.

HOME (O.S.)
In intervals of five minutes, one individual of thirteen will die at random until only one individual is left. You can help or hurt your odds. Your choice.

The Living Room facade cuts too black. The storm surrounding the hime’s trapped occupants rips and roars around the building, beating against the six foot glass. Fear engulfs the occupants.

Glowing bricks of unstable energy emanates from a room above. Slime nudges Tough, they both look above them in disbelief.

All this happens in the briefest moments before all the wall screens tune to a live feed from the

.NURSERY

Peaceful. Almost fully formed. Dreaming of himself as an infant feeding from Mom’s breast.

The water still. Until a bubble works its way up the tank.

Then shafts of bubbles.

MOM (O.S.)
Oh no no no no no. Oh no. No. No. No. No.

The water surrounding New Son begins to boil.

At first, New Son remains still. Then suddenly, his dream changes channels...to the present moment, the here and now, as he boils alive.

New Son thrashes and flails in the tank. The water bubbles so quick, all we see are flashes of limbs and burnt flesh.

New Son’s palm smacks against the glass over and over until the flesh wipes away leaving a blood hand trail (mimic Mom’s hand from earlier). The water now looks like a Jaw attack took place.

.FOYER

All surrounding the Occupants--the boiling almost born son. His bones and skull float around in the tank like apples on Halloween.

Mom hugs the floor.

Dad turns this way and that, but even when he closes his eyes he sees the Son Stew.

The screens cut to black. The outside storm rages on. The glowing toxic energy highlights the home’s foundational crack. The Occupants are all in different states of disbelief. Mom’s on the ground. Dad and Sis frozen. Son not in Frame. The Cops congregate around the front door. Leader’s family cuddle in shock.

The police use their powers to try and unlock the front door. Each give their handheld a try, but they just don’t work.

UNCLE
We’re truly going to be late.

BOSS
Everyone stay your pace.

MISTER LEADER
You’re not in charge anymore.

Leader mimics his dad.

DAD
Damn right. This is my house.

TOUGH
This is a crime scene. Thrice over!

DAD
Damn right!

MISSUS LEADER
But we just want to go!

Leader mimics his mom.

BOSS
(pulls out his weapon)
We all just want to go. So stay your pace until the professionals figure this out.

AUNTIE
Yeah and what are we trying to figure out exactly? What is this?

SIDEKICK
We’re asking the questions, lady.

BOSS
Easy. Easy.

The Cops and the Dads are on one side of the room conversing by the front door. Slime tries to work his magic on the door.

THE DADS
We need to get our wives and children outta here.

THE COPS
We have wives and children too.

.ON THE MOMS AND SIS AND LEADER

Mom reaches in the abyss for her boiled New Son in the basement. Missus Leader nurses her son back to life. Sis observes the Moms from behind them, while also casually checking on the Dads and the cops.

AUNTIE
How do we even know this is real?

MISSUS LEADER
(points to Mom)
Take a look at her.

AUNTIE
Enough with the floor. Stand up already. You did want to get rid of him anyway.

Sis confused.

AUNTIE
Am I wrong? Please speak up if so.

MISSUS LEADER
The woman just lost her son. Give her a break.

AUNTIE
That’s a sweet sentiment, but if I know my sister the way I know my sister...then she’s pissed cause she’s a sore loser.

MOM
How dare you?

AUNTIE
Dare I what?

MOM
Change your mind so goddamned often. It’s not fair. And frankly I blame it on you. Take him or don’t take him. Help me or don’t help me. It’s simple.

AUNTIE
Blame what on me specifically?

MOM
(gesturing all around)
This.

AUNTIE
Typical.

SIS
Hey! What’s going on? What the hell is going on? Take who?

AUNTIE
Your brother.

SIS
Son?

AUNTIE
No the newer one.

MISSUS LEADER
Well if _you_ blame her, then _I_ blame you. Your son’s the reason my Leader was here fraternizing with lower status cadets--

MOM
My Son upended your son’s run, bitch.

MISSUS LEADER
For a brief moment in history.

MOM
History nonetheless.

Mom fixes a drink. Watches the med fiddle with the door far off in the distance.

SIS (O.S.)
Where is he?

AUNTIE (O.S.)
Aw you poor simple thing. He’s not with us anymore.

SIS (O.S.)
No...where is Son?

MOM
Good question. Another question...why was your bedroom glowing, Sis?

MISSUS LEADER
Yes. And another question--when will this charade be over and done with?

Mom steps out from behind the bar, and without concerning herself with either faction, she walks through the foyer...

THE WOMAN (O.S.)
Time’s almost up. What happens then?

Mom heads up a flight of stairs and into the 

.UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

All four bedroom doors are open. A fifth, under construction, has no door, therefore it’s always been open. Mom takes the information in, finishes her drink and then sets it down.

MOM
Son?

.SON’S BEDROOM

Mom peeks in. Calls for Son.

SON (O.S.)
Psst.

.UPSTAIRS HALL

Mom crosses into

.SIS’S BEDROOM

Mom looks around to no apparent sighting of Son.

SON (O.S.)
Is it just you, Mom?

MOM
Yes, who else would it be?

SON (O.S.)
I’m under the bed.

MOM
(crouching down by the bed)
What are you doing under your Sis’s bed?

Son doesn’t answer. Mom crawls under the bed with him.

Mom repeats the last question.

SON
(whispering)
I didn’t want anyone to find me.

MOM
Okay. And why is Sis’s room glowing?

SON
I put explosive materials in her closet.

MOM
Why did you put explosive materials in your Sis’s closet?

SON
Cause I didn’t want anyone to think it was me,

MOM
Where are they?

Son points to the sealed closed closet doors.

MOM
You’re hiding in the room with the explosive materials.

SON
I’ll go quickest when they go off. Do you want to stay here with me?

Mom gives Son a kiss on the forehead.

She slides out from underneath the bed, then darts into the

.UPSTAIRS HALL

Down the stairs

.FOYER

MOM (O.S.)
There’s explosive materials in Sis’s bedroom closet.

Dad looks for the source of Mom’s voice. Mom mixes a martini. The men haven’t opened the door. The woman haven’t stopped discussing the validity of the threat.

Dad is stricken with divine insight (he thinks). Suddenly, if there’s an idea worth having, then Dad is the tuning cable with which divine intervention travels. 

Dad runs to the middle of the room to bridge the gap between the men and the woman.

DAD
It’s nearly five minutes and we’re not nearly out of here.

AUNTIE
Your point?

DAD
There’s explosive--

Materials upstairs.
(stepping in front of Dad)
We liberate those--

DAD
(it’s mine divine intervention)
We use it to blow the door.

SIDEKICK
He’s the boss here.

DAD
This is my--

MOM
Our!

DAD
Goddamit. Our house!

UNCLE
Ladies and gents, our five minutes are past up nearly one whole minute ago. The jig is up. Lets make road drinks and--

TOUGH
Are all accounted for?

.MOM AND UNCLE

Cheers at the bar. They say ‘Aye.’

.FIREPLACE

Sis, Auntie, Leader, and his parents check in. Sis cares for the others.

.FRONT DOOR

Dad and Boss argue trying to upend each other. Slime tries to make a call.

MISSUS LEADER
Where is your villainous dog?

MOM
Under his Sis’s bed. In the room with the explosive materials.

Dad and Boss start to stomp off.

Sis, still cuffed, yells;

SIS
Wait! It’s my room, let me go check it out first.

The Cops quickly discuss in hushed tones.

Sis looks to Mom.

DAD
She is not the violent one. And time is of the essence.

The cops unlock her cuffs.

Sis exits the foyer.

.STAIRS

Ascends slowly, holding a hand to the smooth side.

.UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

Walks to 

.SIS’S ROOM

Quickly dropping to a low floor plank. Son’s not under the bed.

.HALLWAY

SIS
He’s not in my room!...Son? 
(lower)
Where are you?

.SON’S ROOM

She drops to the floor again. Sees Son then quickly dodges--

Nothing. He doesn’t move at the sight of her.

She slides under the bed.

Prods her dead brother.

She beats his face with her fists for awhile, until she works up some rage.

And screams.

She stops. 

Beat.

Suddenly her legs are snatches, dragged from under the bed, she grabs onto Son’s shirt, and drags him out too.

Beaten and dead Son. The Officers tase him for good measure.

SIS
He’s dead.

OFFICERS
Oh.

Slime backs away perturbed. 

Dad checks him. 

Slime draws his weapon.

DAD
Are you okay?

SLIME
Are _you_ okay, Dad? Your Son is dead and none of us have a clue what is happening. I can’t make and calls. We’re lucky our weapons are working and we’re gonna fucking die.

TOUGH
Brother, you need to get a hold of yourself.

Sis quietly crawls out from the bedroom.

.HALLWAY

The Officers argue as she makes her escape.

Dad pops out behind her, Son in his arms.

In the bedroom the Officers argue, chaining Slime to something in Son’s room.

Slime absolutely freaks out (O.S.)

Sis hurries to the

.STAIRS

And descends. Not waiting for Dad, who takes his time mourning his Son.

.FOYER

Sis enters (O.S.) Mom turns to receive her.

SIS
(turns to point)
It’s true.

From a darkened hall, Dad exits holding Son like the Creature from the Black Lagoon. He marches as though in a funeral procession.

Dad places Son upon Leader’s lap. 

Leader laughs, unaware of all realities, then quickly drops Son onto the floor due to either lack of interest or strength, or both.

MISSUS LEADER
How do we _know_ this is real?

Mister Leader, stood perched behind his wife, one hand on her shoulder, drops to the floor and violently convulses as though electricity flowed through his entire nervous system (Texas Chainsaw Massacre). The life shakes out of him as his wife wails in the background, crying and repeating;

MISSUS LEADER
How do we _know_ this is real? How do we? How do we _know_? How do we _know_ this is real?

She enters frame. Leader also falls back because his momma left him. She falls onto her husband and beats him!

She strikes him in the chest repeatedly with her fists.

DAD
What time is it?

BOSS (O.S.)
Time to shut up and pay attention.

The Cops (minus Slime) enter from the darkened hall unified by Boss, on each side Tough and Sidekick. All of them armed and ready for some action. They’re covered in the blood of Slime, and the once arguing police are now unified as one centrifugal force.

BOSS
We lost a man up there and I don’t plan on losing anymore men up there or anywhere, you hear?

MISSUS LEADER
You’ve some nerve on you!

Missus Leader charges at Boss.

The Officers back up a few paces before holding the line steady and hard.

UNCLE
The dance officially started. And probably without us too.

MISSUS LEADER
We just wanted our son, and you were supposed to help us recover him from these deviants.

LEADER
(with glee)
Help us! Help us!

Missus Leader takes a moment to think.

Then pounces on Boss. He’s caught off guard by the assault, drops his weapon on the ground.

Boss spins around with Missus Leader attached to his back. She claws at his bald, slippery head.

Sidekick accidentally shocks Boss with his taser.

Boss falls to the ground with Missus Leader still attached.

The struggle between The Officers and Missus Leader continues on.

Dad mourns over Son.

Auntie joins Mom and Uncle at the

.BAR

AUNTIE
Who is that wretched woman anyway?

UNCLE
Dear, she is the--

AUNTIE
I know who she is.

MOM
What’re you asking then?

AUNTIE
Who does she think she is?

MOM
She thinks she’s entitled to her anger.

AUNTIE
Like you do.

MOM
Like I do.

AUNTIE
How dare the world not give you what you want.

MOM
I didn’t want any of this.

AUNTIE
You wanted all of this.

.ON DAD

Kneeling by Son. Stands up and joins them at the

.BAR

Mom is still calculating a retort.

DAD
All of what?

Auntie gestures all around to the chaos.

DAD
Two dead sons. And counting.

MOM
A divorce.

DAD
This is all your fault.

MOM
I don’t understand.

DAD
We got married and you stopped giving me attention.

MOM
Not everything can always be the beginning. or could be for any extended period of time.

.THE OFFICERS

Zap Missus Leader, who convulses and drops to the floor.

Tough and Sidekick get Boss back on his feet, and as they do, Tough falls to the floor dead.

SIDEKICK
The way I see it, Boss, is we need to better our odds of getting out of here alive.

Boss can’t talk. He responds with a nod of approval.

Boss and sidekick arm themselves, both dual wielding.

Sidekick drops to the knee and digs his weapon into Missus Leader’s neck.

Over and over again. The blood flows freely.

.BAR

Everyone at the bar diverts their attention.

They scream and scramble. Except Mom, Mom finishes her last drink and stays put.

She eyes the bar, trying out different tools as weapons. She wraps her fingers around a sharp mixing stick. Then she quickly falls to the floor, her back up against the bar. Mom grasps the needle close to her. Tears run down her cheeks at first, but then the sobs come, just had to wait long enough for them. O.S. in front of the bar, chaos unfurls, chaos Mom ignores and hides from.

Boss lunges toward Uncle and Dad.

Uncle evades one way, Dad flees the other.

Boss catches hold of Dad, grabbing him by the lapels. Somehow Boss trips up and topples over again,

Uncle surveys the room quickly.

Sidekick runs off into the darkened hall. O.S. Auntie yells. Mom’s crying grows louder. Missus Leader whimpers as she continues to die.

DAD (O.S.)
Hello!?

Uncle dashes to help Dad struggling with Boss trying to shove his weapon into his eyes. Boss is nearly there.

Uncle wraps his arms underneath and around Boss’s shoulders. The position shifts, Boss loses his stance.

Dad taser and anger and survival in hand stabs the weapon over and over into Boss.

Uncle drops the dying body to the floor. Boss quivers collapsed on the floor.

Dad pounces finishing the job with his fists until he’s made pulp and a hole in the floor.

Uncle tries to stop Dad.

UNCLE
Time’s running out.

Moan from Missus Leader.

DAD
Finish her Uncle or we’re finished.

Uncle can’t do it,

Sidekick enters.

UNCLE
Where’s my wife?

Sidekick charges his weapon. So does Uncle and Dad. Uncle mimics Sidekick murdering Missus Leader.

Dad drops dead.

.BY THE FIREPLACE

Sis watches over Leader. She shrieks suddenly as Dad drops dead.

.BEHIND THE BAR

Mom knows the sound of her own kid shrieking. This kicks her out of her own crying fit. She stands up quickly, and

Watches Sis run to Dad’s body, dive onto him, and wrap herself around him.

As a daughter mourns her father, Mom hurries over from behind the bar to shield Sis from the violent fighting taking place between Uncle and Sidekick.

Mom throws herself onto the dog pile and the family, almost complete mourns. Mom notices this non-completeness.

Mom collects Son, drags him to the pile.

The family lays together for the first time in one frame and at peace.

Silhouetted behind them, Uncle and Sidekick finish each other off nearly

.BIRD’S EYE VIEW

Leader slumped on the couch, wagging a leg like a dog wags a tail. The family pile.

Uncle and Sidekick clash then both fall to the floor immobilized, now unable to kill each other.

MOM
Sweetie.

SIS
Shut up, Mom.

MOM
Sweetie.

SIS
What?!

MOM
If we just lay here we’re going to die.

SIS
We’ll die if we do anything too.

MOM
At least there’s a chance. Time’s almost up.

Mom climbs off the pile.

MOM
Do we ride this next wave or do we go to town now?

SIS
What?

MOM
Get up!

SIS
I don’t want to...

MOM
Fine.

Mom goes on a hunt for her sharp spike. Realizes there’s more at the bar.

Mom sticks the spikes between her fingers.

MOM
Sweetie?...

MOM
Answer me...

SIS
What?

MOM
Keep talking to me okay. I need to know if you’re still with me.

Uncle and Sidekick moan. Leader gleefully mocks them.

Mom walks over to the men.

MOM
I said to talk to me.

SIS
I don’t want to talk to you.

MOM
Talk near me then!

SIS
I don’t want to do that either.

MOM
You’re going to do it right now.

Beat. 

Mom bows down next to Sidekick.

MOM
Say the stuff you’ve always wanted to say but were too scared to say.

Beat.

MOM
If not now then when?

SIS
You’re a terrible mom. Me and Son, we hated you. Both. You were so mean. Just all the time.

Mom shoves her spike into the side of Sidekicks head.

He dies.

MOM
Keep talking.

Mom gets up and kneels next to Uncle. Sis continues to complain.

MOM
(to Uncle)
Sorry.

She kills Uncle.

.FIREPLACE

Leader plopped on the couch, the moans give way to silence.

MOM (O.S.)
Talk I said!

Leader lost with what to do now.

SIS (O.S.)
You’re always telling me what to do. All the time and it’s not fair. And I’m sick of you barging into my room.

Mom enters frame. She straddles Leader with regret but decisiveness. She tries to kill Leader,

But he puts up a terribly pitiful fight.

MOM
Keep talking!

SIS
Stop! Stop!

MOM
Keep talking.

Sis grabs onto Mom and throws her onto the floor.

Mom overpowers her easily and starts to choke her, until she passes out.

Mom re-straddles Leader, grabs his face, holds it sideways and slips a spike right into his ear.

Mom awakens Sis.

MOM
Now you need to help.

SIS
I thought I was dead.

MOM
You’re not. Time’s nearly up.

SIS
I don’t care.

MOM
I do. And I want you to live.

SIS
It doesn’t matter what you want anymore.

MOM
I’m going to sacrifice myself for you.

SIS
This was all your doing and now you want to sacrifice yourself?

MOM
Let me make it up to you.

SIS
Why should I survive this? For what purpose?

Mom begins stabbing herself in the stomach, letting blood.

SIS
Stop it!

MOM
I can’t! I don’t want to wait around to see what happens.

SIS
It’s not your decision.

MOM
Kill me!

SIS
No.

MOM
Kill your Mom.

Mom stabs herself more.

Sis retreats from Mom chasing her around the room, turning down the darkened hallway.

.KITCHEN

Sis pulls open a drawer and pulls out a knife. She holds it to her wrist.

MOM
No! Don’t hurt yourself.

SIS
I’m trying to help you.

MOM
By harming yourself?

Mom and Sis self harm duel.

Sis sits propped up in an uncomfortable chair. And much worse for wear. Her skin eaten by the acid. Broken bones wrapped in casts.

A make-up attendant enters frame. Starts patting Sis down with skin reformer, filling in the gaps of eaten flesh.

After a minute of tending to, Sis looks like new, but certainly doesn’t feel like new.

Sis starts up a coughing fit.

DIP TO WHITE

Sis, composed, sits in frame with an attractive vanilla reporter for the stars, in what becomes a reality tv recap show.

REPORTER
Tonight we’re here with our winner and a panel of selected top engaging viewers to jump-in and ask questions. But first question on all our minds is: how are you?

Sis coughs up blood onto her new outfit.  

While Sis is touched up;

REPORTER
In just a few short words. How are you feeling about this win? Walking away with your life, what is on your mind?

Beat.

REPORTER
Uh--

SIS
I’d like to thank the people who watched--

REPORTER
Speaking of people who watched. We’re going to bring in some viewer experiences now.

Were you surprised or caught--

SIS
Yes.

VIEWER 2
When did you know you were going to win?

SIS
I didn’t.

VIEWER 3
I was gonna ask something else--but, who’d you think was gonna win?

SIS
I really didn’t know.

VIEWER 4
How have you changed?

SIS
I think I used to give my energy to the wrong things, or the right things for the wrong reasons, and now...I don’t know. I feel like I should be giving my life to you.

We track the words Sis reads on a teleprompter.

INT. DINING ROOM

Festivities commence for a Pagan holiday (looks like Thanksgiving).

Mom and her extended family sit around a large rectangular table filled with food. Four chairs are empty.

The only others we recognize are Auntie and Uncle, who are dressed in holiday specific garb, and their children matching. All the families are dressed accordingly.

Mom sips from her drink until its empty.

The love and happiness swells around her.

She sets her drink down, then finally picks up utensils and slices into the food on her plate, then puts in a tiny bit in her mouth, chasing it with another martini.

Mom hears her name mentioned. She looks around the table, spots Auntie laughing at her.

MOM
(to Auntie)
They’ll be here any minute.

AUNTIE
Huh?

Mom still hears the ringing of gossip in her ear. At the far end of the table, Grandma and Grandpa communicate silently. Mom could tell.

MOM
(louder)
They’ll be here any minute!

The room quiets down. We can hear the crackle of a burning fire.

A dumb-waiter arm pops out from the table, fills Mom’s drink.

GRANDMA
Oh, I’m sure they will be dear...whoever they might be!

Grandma laughs. 

The room picks up its energy again.

MOM
(to herself)
Then why are you laughing at me?

Someone from the table exclaims: “cigars!”

GRANDPA
Excellent!

All the men start getting up from their chairs.

GRANDPA
May we, dear?

Grandma deliberates, then says:

GRANDMA
Oh, of course!

.NURSERY/KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOM

Children sleep on mats on the floor in the midst of nap time.

We single out a boy, whose features resemble Dad’s, sound asleep. A snore escapes from Dad, but the disruptive snore returns back to a blissful sleep.

In the unfocused background, as we watch Dad sleep, some movement happens behind Dad. The movement comes into focus and it’s a classmate make his way carefully to Dad.

MATE pokes Dad in the back. It doesn’t wake him.

Another poke from Mate prompts a louder snore from Dad.

Mate grabs Dad’s nose.

Dad starts breathing form his mouth.

Mate covers Dad’s mouth.

Dad juts awake. Mate latched onto him, releases Dad’s nose, whispers in his ear;

MATE
Wanna go outside?

The both look toward the teacher. Her heads down on the desk.

Dad and Mate crawl over and around their sleeping peers.

Mate gets to the door first. As he creaks it open, Dad crashes into a Peer.

Peer wakes up grabbing his head, already with a large bump. Just as he’s about to scream--

Mate grabs Peer’s mouth to silence him. Mate gives Dad eye daggers then invites Peer with them.

The Three of them slip past the door.

As the door is about to slam shut, a hand reached in to slow its close, and then closes it quietly.

CUT TO:

EXT. WESTERN FRONT - NIGHT

Soldiers wade in differing depths of boiling mud along a reinforced trench stretching and winding through a wasteland of terrain. Some soldiers up to their calves or ankles, and others up to their chest, neck, and in some cases eyes. 

Above them the fireworks of war explode to no distinct or discernible pattern.  

Behind the men, orders are yelled and screamed at the top of the respective commanding officer’s lungs. 

In long rows, one line at a time charges up the trench wall and into No-Man’s Land. As each row charges there is a most certain uptick in the rapidity of enemy machine-gun fire.

In No-Man’s Land, almost instantly, upon arising from the trench, the soldiers chewed to bits by bullets.In the most recent wave, the men are cut into pieces, some right in half, by the fire.

Son, a few rows to go before reaching the running line, whimpers as he holds his gun above his head and melts in the mud with the rest of the soldiers. 

He cries to himself: “why?”

The lines shift, but Son, preoccupied with pain, lags and the person behind, RUSH, shoves him forward. 

This sends Son headlong into the mud. His gun falls from his hands.

He cries for help, or tries to but RUSH pushes him down further by shoving a boot into his face and stepping over him.

Son emerges from the mud, trying to wipe his eyes--but now it’s as if the whole army is against him, pushing and shoving violently the boy who fell out of line and lost his weapon. 

He tries to regain his composure, and sifts through the mud to find his weapon.

Something pushes him under deep. This time in the pitch darkness, the muted sounds of war, the pummeling becomes peaceful.

But there ain’t not rest for the wicked. Suddenly, Son’s up and in line. In front of him, Leader, around him the rest of the people from the home.

Leader’s line commences up the trench.

Son, weaponless, looks both ways as if crossing a street, then darts to following behind Leader.

Leader hovers at the top of the trench, peeks over, fires a few rounds and ducks.

Son almost takes another boot heel to the face. 

Leader hops over and leaves Son’s sight.

CUT TO:

INT. FANCY RESTAURANT

Sis is wined and dined by high power industry professionals, or executive producers. 

The table is filled with food but also scripts, a large stack of them right in the center. We come into the lunch before any business talk came into play. Everyone is having a gay old time, laughing and trying to entertain Sis, who is only half (or less) amused. 

Judging by Sis’s outfit, this is only moments after the previous exits interview.

A line of waiters surrounds the table and place down a new plate in front of the patrons, then file out of a from with used dishes now in hand.

In the plate before Sis, a cornucopia of seafood--or, to Sis, a pile of guts. Sis shoves a knife into a hunk of meat. Pulling the knife out, a small burst of black liquid squirts out (like bile).

SOMEONE
(whispering)
To die for, right?

The executive presenting a pitch for a new show that Sis would be a part of wraps up his pitch. We can barely hear him/her, they’re muted and what we hear are the antagonizations and whispers of all those around her, and the sound of her playing with her food.

SOMEONE ELSE
So authentic, tight?

ANOTHER
I had my money on you the whole time.

AND ANOTHER
We all did.

ANOTHER
Not you!

AND ANOTHER
How’d you know?

Sis submerges her hand in the black bile. Her eyes never leaving the plate. As the bees continue to buzz around her head.

Suddenly the room erupts into applause.

Sis joins in a few beats behind the room, the black bile splashing onto her face and clothes and onto the people around her.

This mess doesn’t hurt their feelings, at least not on the surface. They laugh, then wipe the collateral spill from they faces.

Everyone sits back down.

M.C.
Sissy dearest, we have a few more presentations before we hear from the network president. Hopefully, these projects are life affirming and exciting to your ears.

Sis holds up her blacked hand for everyone to see. And applaud.

EXT. GRANDPARENT’S APARTMENT BLOCK

We’re just outside a skyscraper apartment complex, looking through glass doors into the building lobby. A few people congregate near the entrance smoking cigars. The crowd is jovial, having playful banter until someone hushes the others. “Sh sh sh shhh.”

Moments later, Mom exits through the glass doors. A few beats of stumbling over words as Mom passes through the crowd and takes the head of the group.

GRANDPA
I didn’t know you smoked.

MOM
I didn’t.

Mom fumbles with her mobile, ignoring everyone else for something obviously way more important than whatever might be happening around her. 

She leaves the group to stand by herself to the side.

A rideshare pulls up, blocking our view of everyone.

SMOKER (O.S.)
Leaving already?

GRANDPA (O.S.)
We haven’t even had dessert yet.

.RIDESHARE

The car closes as Mom gets in and settles down into a lonely cry. She can’t focus, every which way captures her attention. She slides her mobile into her hand and--

MOM
To Dad, how dare you? You left me alone at the party. And I was the only one alone. Where are you? Where are the kids? No one has answered me all day. At first I was pissed, but now I’m just worried something bad happened. Why are you ignoring me?...send.

The message appears in 3D space as she speaks them, it then packages itself in an envelope then zips off into the digital highway.

The tears return.

As does the message;

INT. PLAYGROUND

Dad and Mate and Peer, fully grown adults in body, but toddler at heart, stand before a massive jungle gym, shifting and moving like a living breathing Transformer robot.

DAD
You know we shouldn’t be out here.

PEER
Why did I know you were--

MATE
Dont say that.

Mate shoves Dad into the jungle gym, which swallows him whole. 

Dad screams with joy as he slides down a slide, twisting and turning through a nearly darkened tube.

Dad crash lands at the bottom of the slide. The voices of his friends sound as if they’re descending now too, but then they get further away.

Dad peeks his head up through the slide’s tube to call for them.

They appear together in the distance in some other area of the massive jungle gym.

“You better run!” They scream at him.

Blood lust flashes in their eyes.

Dad hurries off quick into the network of tunnels, climbing over and under obstacles, and he’s running and running until--

He comes out one side of a tube and falls headlong into a ball pit.

Dad struggles in the sea of multi-colored plastic balls. As he begins to sink into the pit, he lets out a cry of fear--

The other boys hear the scream and the fussing happening in the ball pit.

And they appear on the other end, far from Dad.

They jump into the balls, and make their way to Dad.

What a first seems like a playful struggle, quickly becomes violent as the boys gang up on Dad. One grabs him from behind, the other struggles to get Dad’s pants off.

An intercom sounds off summoning the boys back to nap time.

CUT TO:

EXT. NO-MAN’S LAND

In the dark depth of No Man’s Land, Son follows closely behind Leader (who seems to be perfectly in his element) as he leaps and bounds from cover to cover, returning fire when he can, being smart about.

Son spots an un-manned weapon and as he leaps for it a spray of bullets rip into him.

Son grabs the weapon and returns fire in the direction from which he was shot.

Son and Leader lock scopes on the other. Neither fire. Leader gestures for Son to follow.

Son runs up behind him.

A few more bullets spray from behind enemy lines--Son ducks and dives nearly falling into a bomb-torn pit. Leader against better judgment reach for Son to save him.

Son tumbles and collides with a bombardment of sharp slicing bayonets.

Leader takes a bullet to the head--his brains blow out the back of his entire head, but leaves only the smallest entry hole.

Leader tumbles down the pit, falling, and impaling next to Son who misses his bottom half.

The sound of bullets and bombs and warfare quiets. The groans and moans of the impaled soldiers (the skewered soldiers) grows to take up all the sound waves of their immediate space. Arguments and debates take shape around Son and Leader as they get their bearings or what’s left of their bearings.

“Aye! You’re on my groin!”

“Watch where you’re dripping!”

Further away two debate who should’ve been covering who.

Leader screams. Or tries to cause it’s hard without a head.

SON
Shut up!

LEADER
You shouldn’t have been following me.

SON
You’re my Leader.

LEADER
Every man for himself.

A large flatbed rolls down manned by an obscured dark figure. The darkened limbs remove body parts and bodies from the spiked pit and stacks them on the flat bed as best as possible.

The Shape grabs Leader by the empty skull and tosses him on the pile. Then Son follows suit onto the top of the pile.

The flatbed begins its trek back to the entry line.

A bomb falls.

Son is sent flying back to No Man’s Land alone.

MAKE-UP ARTIST
Oh you wear the wrinkles well.

Sis sees herself (really sees herself) and doesn’t like it.

MAKE-UP ARTIST
Purse your lips real tight like you’re sucking on a lemon. Come on, you can do it.

AGENT steps from the background into the foreground,

AGENT
Let’s review. You’re playing the Aunt in this scenario. We tried to get you in as the Mom, but she was already cast and they were pretty firm on their decision. Don’t worry, you’ll still get plenty of screen time as the protagonist’s sister. And you have an interesting B-Story. Will you or won’t you take the baby? That’s where your character defining moment comes from.

SIS
But I’ve been practicing--

AGENT
That type of but aint in your vocabulary. This aint no huge stretch for you you. You don’t change your lines or any of your character moments. All that’s shifted to the Aunt. So use that. I believe in you. Now there’s space for a true underdog story. Once a winner always a winner.

A red light comes on. Followed by a screen divided into four segments. The feeds from another MOM2, DAD2, SIS2, SON2 reality death show start up.

AGENT
This is one of my favorite parts.

MOM2 and DAD2 start fucking.

The Make-Up Artist stops.

MAKE-UP ARTIST
My favorite part too. This new Dad is hot.

The lights come on, revealing a white empty desolate home. 

Mom hears voices--

.KITCHEN

Ghosts of family past walks through and around the kitchen, actions and movements from different times.

As Mom enters all of that disappears. A replay of a different memory from the beginning of the story with Mom and Auntie plays.

From the corner of her eye, Dad waves her over to him.

.UPSTAIRS HALL

Mom surrounded by closed sealed doors.

She hears Sis calling--Bangs on her door--it disappears.

The same happens with Son.

Mom throws herself against the now gone doors, violently, until  she falls on the floor.

Regaining her composure, one more door--

It opens at the end of the long hallways.

The boys fall to the floor in pain (Dad included).

TEACHER (O.S.)
Learn to control yourselves.

Dad gets to his feet first--he lunges at Peer, still recovering from pain.

Mate intercepts, ratchets his body around Dad.

And they unload some pain upon him.

Mate and Peer drag Dad out of the Ball pit. At first he fights--

But then he submits as they drag him through the darkened tunnels of the advanced jungle gym.

Just as before, so it is again. With pain un-ashamed to repeat itself, Sis tussles with her new castmates as the crack in the structure of the house widens and starts to fill with toxic poisonous water (like some kind of ride from Universal Studios [the Earthquake ride]). The system is rigged to go off in different but similar ways. This time Sis aint so lucky. (There’s a whole behind the scenes setup we get glimpses of via Sis’s last few scenes.)

CUT TO:

.AUNTIE’S HOUSE

Auntie chops vegetables, mirroring Mom from the first scene.

Mom shows up, not to make small talk, but to beg to take Mom’s New Son back, who sits at the table eagerly awaiting dinner and keeping Auntie company. 

Mom tries to grab him.

Mom and Auntie have a tug-o-war over New Son.

CUT TO:

.CLASSROOM

Dad, Mate, and Peer stand before the entire classroom (now awakened from their naps). The teacher paces in front of them.

CUT TO:

EXT. MEDIC TENT

Son exits the tent, stitched together like a mecha-Frankenstein.
