## Logline

When a mysterious Black Box activates inside a dysfunctional family's smart home on the eve of their divorce, they become trapped subjects in a deadly surveillance experiment orchestrated by an unseen cabal, forcing them to confront their darkest secrets as the house turns against them.

---

## Synopsis

In a near-future world of perpetual rain, the upper-middle-class family of Li (mother, 40s), Fre (father, 40s), Sus (daughter, 17), and Rok (son, 16) live in a surveillance-saturated smart home. Their youngest, Lef, gestates in a basement grow-tank, dreaming of futures that will never arrive.

The film opens with a formally striking sequence: four camera quadrants capture each family member in intimate, censored moments—masturbation, undressing, vomiting, arriving home—their loops syncing into a unified image before the title. A countdown timecode begins.

Li announces her intention to divorce Fre, who receives the news with practiced indifference; this is apparently not their first attempt. The children already know and don't care. The family disperses into their parallel days: Li works in construction and conducts a violent affair with client Def; Fre draws architectural plans and fucks his mistress Nol until she dumps him; Sus practices ballet under the predatory attention of instructor Mis Sar; Rok wrestles, wins, and rebuffs the advances of girlfriend Em while lingering too long on teammate Gre.

Meanwhile, in a shadowy headquarters, robed women monitor the family on screens. The elder Wot and her successor Jra debate "Series A vs Series B" while operative Lon plots sabotage—"here to burn it down."

A Black Box, mysteriously delivered that morning, activates at dinnertime. The house turns hostile: doors slam on Rok's foot, crushing it; temperatures in Lef's grow-tank spike; the family is locked in the basement to watch their unborn child boil alive. As Lef dies, the doors open, and the Black Box issues an ultimatum: "Go to your rooms."

The script terminates mid-third-act as the family separates under countdown, with the Black Box's game mechanics—forcing family members to betray each other—introduced but not dramatized.

## Assessment Matrix

| Category | Rating | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Concept/Premise** | ●●●●○ | Strong formal concept; surveillance grammar is inventive; premise has commercial and artistic potential |
| **Structure** | ●●○○○ | Incomplete third act; fragmented POV; weak causal binding between inciting incident and consequences |
| **Character** | ●●●○○ | Li is compelling; others are sketched; HQ characters underdeveloped; no complete arc |
| **Dialogue** | ●●●●○ | The bathroom argument is excellent; domestic cruelty rendered with precision; HQ scenes too expository |
| **Theme** | ●●●○○ | Rich thematic material (surveillance, family death, complicity) but underintegrated |
| **Visual/Formal Innovation** | ●●●●● | Exceptional; the multi-cam grammar, censorship as motif, timecode structure are genuinely original |
| **Market Potential** | ●●●○○ | Niche appeal; festival-to-streaming pathway; comparable to A24/Neon horror acquisitions |

**Overall Assessment:** ●●●○○ (3/5)

## Strengths

1. **Formal Originality** [AESTHETE]: The opening quadrant sequence, the use of CENSORED as visual motif, the timecode countdown, and the consistent surveillance POV create a distinctive formal identity. This is not a script that could be mistaken for anything else.

2. **Domestic Cruelty** [RHETORICIAN]: The bathroom argument (lines 412-578) is the script's strongest scene—acidic, rhythmic, and revealing. The dialogue here achieves what the rest of the script aspires to: cruelty that illuminates character.

3. **World-Building Through Texture** [ART_HIST]: The script creates its near-future through accumulation of detail rather than exposition: perpetual rain, hover-cars, grow-tanks, drug dispensers, digital hair products. This is effective environmental storytelling.

4. **Thematic Density** [ACADEMIC]: The script engages meaningfully with surveillance culture, mediated intimacy, family as performance, and environmental despair. There's intellectual substance beneath the genre mechanics.

5. **Li as Protagonist Potential** [DRAMATURGIST]: Though the script fragments across four family members, Li emerges as the most active, mysterious, and dramatically rich character. Her violence against Def and her coldness toward Lef's death suggest hidden depths.

## Weaknesses

1. **Incomplete Narrative** [DRAMATURGIST]: The script terminates mid-third-act. The moral-choice game mechanic (forcing family members to betray each other) is introduced at line 2717 but never dramatized. This is a first draft problem that must be addressed.

2. **HQ Subplot Failure** [NARRATOLOGIST]: The scenes at headquarters (Wot, Jra, Lon) consume significant page space but deliver minimal narrative payoff. They neither explain the mystery nor affect the family's situation. They feel like a different film.

3. **Weak Causal Logic** [NARRATOLOGIST]: The Black Box's activation appears unmotivated by family actions. Why this family? Why today? The script operates on "AND THEN" logic rather than "BUT/THEREFORE" causation.

4. **Abandoned Threads** [FIRST-READER]: The Sus/Mis Sar abuse thread is introduced with disturbing specificity then dropped. Rok's apparent closeted sexuality is suggested but not developed. These feel like setups without payoffs.

5. **Tonal Inconsistency** [CINEPHILE]: The script oscillates between domestic naturalism, Grand Guignol horror, satirical distance, and surveillance art-film. These modes don't cohere into a unified tonal register.

## Recommendation

**CONSIDER WITH REVISIONS**

This is a first draft with genuine ambition and formal sophistication. The surveillance grammar is original; the domestic cruelty is well-rendered; the thematic concerns are substantive. However, the incomplete third act, the unintegrated HQ subplot, and the weak causal logic prevent recommendation in current form.

With a completed third act, a clear decision about the HQ material (cut or integrate), and a strengthened causal spine connecting family dysfunction to Black Box activation, this could be a compelling festival-track genre film in the lineage of Haneke's *Caché* and *Funny Games*.

**Priority Revisions:**
1. Complete the third act (15-25 additional pages)
2. Decide HQ: eliminate entirely or integrate meaningfully
3. Establish causal connection between family and Black Box
4. Center Li as protagonist with complete arc
5. Resolve or eliminate Sus/Mis Sar and Rok/Gre threads
