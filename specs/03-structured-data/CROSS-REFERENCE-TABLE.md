## Sequence Cross-References

### Sequence A: Anthology & Myth-Remix Tradition
**Studies:** Ovid (Metamorphoses) ↔ Gaiman (Sandman)

| Shared Principle | Ovid Implementation | Gaiman Implementation |
|------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Embedded Narrative | Nested storytellers within carmen perpetuum | Stories-within-stories with Morpheus as frame |
| Anthology Structure | 15 books, ~250 episodes | 75 issues, 10 collected volumes |
| Mythic Substitution | Roman/Greek myth recontextualization | Cross-pantheon synthesis (Norse, Egyptian, Japanese) |
| Tonal Modulation | Epic/elegiac/comic register shifts | Horror/fantasy/slice-of-life oscillation |
| Metamorphosis as Theme | Physical transformation as narrative engine | Identity transformation through dream logic |

---

### Sequence B: Cinematic Interiority
**Studies:** Tarkovsky ↔ Bergman

| Shared Principle | Tarkovsky Implementation | Bergman Implementation |
|------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Time as Material | "Sculpting in time" — duration as medium | Temporal compression in chamber drama |
| Spiritual Revelation | Orthodox mysticism, showing vs explaining | Existential confrontation, God's silence |
| Facial Phenomenology | Extended contemplative close-ups | Face as landscape, merged identity |
| Reduced Cast | Small ensemble, internal focus | Chamber drama minimalism |
| Silence as Structure | Rhythmic silence between dialogue | Silence as confession space |

**Key Divergence:** Tarkovsky seeks transcendence through nature/memory; Bergman excavates psychological interiority through confrontation.

---

### Sequence C: Formalism vs Hypersigil
**Studies:** Alan Moore ↔ Grant Morrison

| Principle | Moore Implementation | Morrison Implementation |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Grid as Structure | 9-panel grid as musical score | Grid as reality layer separator |
| Metafiction | Formal awareness, reader as observer | Fiction-reality collapse, reader as participant |
| Comics as Magic | Kabbalah-influenced, text as ritual | Chaos magic, hypersigil as transformation |
| Reader Role | Witness to formal complexity | Co-creator of reality shift |
| Information Density | Re-readability through layered reference | Compression requiring active decoding |

**Fundamental Contrast:**
- **Moore:** Structure reveals meaning through formal control
- **Morrison:** Structure dissolves boundaries between fiction and reality

---

### Sequence D: Mythopoeia Across Media
**Studies:** Kirby (Fourth World) ↔ Tolkien (Legendarium)

| Shared Principle | Kirby Implementation | Tolkien Implementation |
|------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Cosmic Dualism | New Genesis vs Apokolips | Arda vs Morgoth/Sauron |
| Sub-Creation | Fourth World cosmology | Arda, complete with languages |
| Mythic Scale | Gods, Source Wall, Anti-Life | Valar, Silmarils, One Ring |
| Good/Evil Binary | Highfather/Darkseid | Ilúvatar/Melkor |
| Legacy/Succession | Orion vs Darkseid (father-son) | Generations of heroes across ages |

**Key Divergence:**
- **Kirby:** Visual dynamism, technological myth, American optimism
- **Tolkien:** Philological depth, pastoral elegy, Northern European pessimism

---

### Sequence E: Interactive Narrative Approaches
**Studies:** Zelda ↔ Final Fantasy

| Principle | Zelda Implementation | Final Fantasy Implementation |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| Protagonist | Silent, player-projected | Ensemble with distinct voices |
| Narrative Mode | Spatial/environmental storytelling | Cutscene-driven, operatic |
| Progression | Non-linear exploration | Linear with embedded systems |
| Emotional Core | Discovery, mystery, wonder | Loss, sacrifice, hope |
| Time Structure | Eternal return (Link reborn) | Linear with finality (character death) |
| Player Agency | Mechanical mastery = story | Role-playing = emotional investment |

**Fundamental Contrast:**
- **Zelda:** Narrative emerges from player-world interaction
- **Final Fantasy:** Narrative delivered, player experiences alongside characters

---

### Sequence F: Non-Linear Masters
**Studies:** Tarantino ↔ Ovid (cross-links to Sequence A)

| Shared Principle | Tarantino Implementation | Ovid Implementation |
|------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Chronological Disruption | Chapter structure, temporal scrambling | Non-linear myth ordering |
| Episode Linking | Thematic/character connections across chapters | Metamorphic chain linking |
| Transformation via Juxtaposition | Violence/mundane contrast | Before/after transformation |
| Delayed Revelation | Information withheld for impact | Transformation's meaning emerges retroactively |
| Genre Awareness | Pastiche, homage, subversion | Awareness of prior tellings |

---

### Sequence G: Emotional Engineering
**Studies:** Pixar ↔ Final Fantasy

| Shared Principle | Pixar Implementation | Final Fantasy Implementation |
|------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| Engineered Empathy | Opening sequences, "married life" | Character backstory, flashback systems |
| Loss/Hope Cycles | Loss as catalyst, hope as resolution | Death as narrative punctuation, hope as theme |
| Ensemble Management | Toy Story ensemble dynamics | Party system, spotlight rotation |
| Emotional Climax | "When She Loved Me," "Married Life" | Aerith's death, Tidus's fade |
| Dual Audience | Adult/child emotional layers | Mechanical/narrative satisfaction layers |
