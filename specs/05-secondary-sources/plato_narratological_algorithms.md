## 0. Meta-Principles (Axioms)

| Axiom | Formulation |
|-------|-------------|
| P0 | "A man is not to be reverenced more than the truth" â€” evaluation must be dispassionate |
| P1 | All poetical imitations are "ruinous to the understanding of the hearers" without knowledge of their true nature |
| P2 | "The imitative art is an inferior who marries an inferior, and has inferior offspring" |
| P3 | Narrative form affects soul formation â€” stories shape the psyche |
| P4 | There is an "ancient quarrel between philosophy and poetry" |
| P5 | The goal of narrative regulation is justice in the soul, not aesthetic pleasure |

### Source Quotes

> "All poetical imitations are ruinous to the understanding of the hearers, and that the knowledge of their true nature is the only antidote to them." â€”Republic X

> "The tragic poet is an imitator, and therefore, like all other imitators, he is thrice removed from the king and from the truth." â€”Republic X

> "Poetry feeds and waters the passions instead of drying them up; she lets them rule, although they ought to be controlled." â€”Republic X

> "We must remain firm in our conviction that hymns to the gods and praises of famous men are the only poetry which ought to be admitted into our State." â€”Republic X

## 1. The Three Modes of Narration

Plato distinguishes three fundamental modes by which poets relate events:

```
NARRATIVE_MODES:
â”œâ”€â”€ DIEGESIS (Simple Narration)
â”‚   Definition: Poet speaks in own voice throughout
â”‚   Example: Dithyramb
â”‚   Effect: Poet never conceals himself
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ MIMESIS (Imitation)
â”‚   Definition: Poet speaks as if he were another person
â”‚   Example: Tragedy, Comedy
â”‚   Effect: Poet "assimilates his style to that of the person"
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ MIXED MODE
    Definition: Alternation between diegesis and mimesis
    Example: Epic (Homer)
    Effect: "Double form" â€” narrative with embedded speeches
```

### 1.1 Formal Definitions

```python
class NarrativeMode:
    """Plato's taxonomy of storytelling methods."""
    
    DIEGESIS = "simple_narration"
    # "The poet is speaking in his own person;
    #  he never leads us to suppose that he is any one else."
    
    MIMESIS = "imitation"  
    # "The poet speaks in the person of another...
    #  assimilates his style to that of the person."
    
    MIXED = "combination"
    # "The combination of both is found in epic."

def identify_mode(passage):
    """
    Determine narrative mode of a passage.
    """
    if speaker == poet_voice:
        if no_character_speeches:
            return DIEGESIS
        else:
            return MIXED
    elif speaker == character_voice:
        return MIMESIS
```

### 1.2 The Homer Transformation Example

Plato demonstrates how the same content changes across modes:

```
ORIGINAL (Mixed Mode - Homer):
  "And he prayed all the Greeks... the poet is speaking in his own
   person... But in what follows he takes the person of Chryses."

TRANSFORMED TO DIEGESIS:
  "The priest came and prayed the gods on behalf of the Greeks...
   Thus he spoke, and the other Greeks revered the priest and assented.
   But Agamemnon was wroth, and bade him depart..."

TRANSFORMED TO PURE MIMESIS:
  "The intermediate passages are omitted, and the dialogue only left."
  â†’ Tragedy form
```

### 1.3 Mode Evaluation

```
PLATONIC_MODE_PREFERENCE:

  PREFERRED:    Diegesis (poet visible)
  CAUTIOUS:     Mixed (poet partially visible)
  DANGEROUS:    Pure Mimesis (poet concealed)

RATIONALE:
  Mimesis â†’ Actor "assimilates" to character
         â†’ Repeated assimilation shapes soul
         â†’ Soul becomes what it imitates
```

---

## 2. The Ontological Hierarchy (Three Removes from Truth)

The metaphysical foundation of Plato's critique: reality exists in degrees.

```
ONTOLOGICAL_HIERARCHY:

Level 1: FORMS (Ideas)
         â”œâ”€â”€ Made by: God/Nature
         â”œâ”€â”€ Quantity: One only (unique)
         â”œâ”€â”€ Status: "True existence," "the essence"
         â””â”€â”€ Example: The Idea of Bed

              â†“ (One remove)

Level 2: PARTICULARS (Things)
         â”œâ”€â”€ Made by: Craftsman/Artisan
         â”œâ”€â”€ Quantity: Many particular instances
         â”œâ”€â”€ Status: "Semblance of existence"
         â””â”€â”€ Example: A carpenter's bed

              â†“ (Two removes)

Level 3: IMAGES (Imitations)
         â”œâ”€â”€ Made by: Imitator (painter, poet)
         â”œâ”€â”€ Quantity: Infinite reproductions possible
         â”œâ”€â”€ Status: "Appearance," "thrice removed from truth"
         â””â”€â”€ Example: A painting of a bed
```

### 2.1 The Three Beds Argument

```python
def three_beds_hierarchy():
    """
    Plato's famous example demonstrating ontological levels.
    """
    
    # Level 1: The Form
    ideal_bed = Form(
        maker="God",
        quantity=1,  # "One bed in nature and one only"
        status="essentially and by nature one only",
        property="true existence"
    )
    
    # Level 2: The Particular
    physical_bed = Particular(
        maker="carpenter",
        quantity="many",
        status="indistinct expression of truth",
        relation_to_form="made in accordance with the idea"
    )
    
    # Level 3: The Image
    painted_bed = Image(
        maker="painter",
        quantity="infinite",
        status="thrice removed from the king and from the truth",
        relation_to_particular="appearance only"
    )
    
    return [ideal_bed, physical_bed, painted_bed]
```

### 2.2 Why God Made Only One Form

```
ARGUMENT:
  IF God made two beds:
    THEN "a third would still appear behind them
          which both of them would have for their idea"
    AND that third would be the true ideal bed
  
  THEREFORE:
    God "desired to be the real maker of a real bed,
        not a particular maker of a particular bed"
    
  CONCLUSION:
    Form must be unique; multiplicity = descent from truth
```

### 2.3 Imitation of Appearances

```
CRITICAL_DISTINCTION:

  QUESTION: Does the painter imitate reality or appearance?
  
  TEST: "You may look at a bed from different points of view,
         obliquely or directly or from any other point of view,
         and the bed will appear different, but there is no
         difference in reality."
  
  ANSWER: "The imitator is a long way off the truth, and can do
           all things because he lightly touches on a small part
           of them, and that part an image."
  
  THEREFORE:
    Painting/Poetry = imitation of appearance
                    â‰  imitation of reality
```

## 3. The Userâ€“Makerâ€“Imitator Knowledge Hierarchy

Three arts concern every object; they form a knowledge hierarchy:

```
KNOWLEDGE_HIERARCHY:

                    KNOWLEDGE
                        â”‚
    â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”
    â”‚                   â”‚                   â”‚
  USER              MAKER              IMITATOR
(episteme)      (correct belief)    (neither)
    â”‚                   â”‚                   â”‚
    â–¼                   â–¼                   â–¼
 KNOWS             BELIEVES             GUESSES
excellence         from user            at appearance
    â”‚                   â”‚                   â”‚
    â–¼                   â–¼                   â–¼
"speaks with      "confiding in him,    "will no more have
 authority"        will do what he       true opinion than
                   is told"              knowledge"
```

### 3.1 The Flute Example

```python
def knowledge_distribution(object_type="flute"):
    """
    Plato's three-tier knowledge hierarchy.
    """
    
    user = Agent(
        role="flute_player",
        knowledge_type="episteme",  # True knowledge
        source="direct experience of use",
        function="indicates to maker good or bad qualities"
    )
    
    maker = Agent(
        role="flute_maker", 
        knowledge_type="correct_belief",  # pistis
        source="from user, by talking to him",
        function="attain correct belief by compulsion"
    )
    
    imitator = Agent(
        role="painter_of_flutes",
        knowledge_type="neither",
        source="no use, no instruction",
        function="imitate what appears good to ignorant multitude"
    )
    
    return {
        "who_knows": user,
        "who_believes": maker,
        "who_neither": imitator
    }
```

### 3.2 The Imitator's Ignorance

```
CRITIQUE:
  
  "The imitative artist will be in a brilliant state of
   intelligence about his own creations?" â€” "Nay, very much
   the reverse."
  
  MECHANISM:
    Imitator has no use of the thing â†’ no knowledge of excellence
    Imitator has no instruction from user â†’ no correct belief
    
  RESULT:
    "Still he will go on imitating without knowing what makes
     a thing good or bad, and may be expected therefore to
     imitate only that which appears to be good to the
     ignorant multitude."
```

---

## 4. The Tripartite Soul and Mimetic Address

Plato's psychology determines which part of the soul imitation addresses.

### 4.1 The Three Parts of the Soul

```
TRIPARTITE_SOUL:

## 5. Content Regulation Algorithms

Plato's prescriptive rules for permissible narrative content.

### 5.1 Theological Content Rules

```

       myths â€” telling how certain gods 'Go about by night in the
       likeness of so many strangers'"
  
  IMPLEMENTATION:
    IF narrative.depicts(god.transforms()):
        REJECT("blasphemy against the gods")


RULE_3: GOD_DOES_NOT_DECEIVE

  PERMITTED: God is "perfectly simple and true both in word and deed"
  FORBIDDEN: God deceives "either by sign or word, by dream or waking vision"

    - Apollo's false prophecy to Thetis (Aeschylus)
```

### 5.2 Heroic Content Rules

```
RULE_4: NO_FEAR_OF_DEATH_IN_UNDERWORLD

  FORBIDDEN:
    - Descriptions of Hades as terrible
    - Heroes lamenting death
    - Souls "flitting about like shadows"
  
  RATIONALE:
    "If our future guardians believed this to be true, they would
     hardly be likely to face death fearlessly."
  
  IMPLEMENTATION:

        REJECT("makes cowards of guardians")


RULE_5: NO_EXCESSIVE_LAMENTATION

  FORBIDDEN:
    - "Pitiful hero drawling out his sorrows in a long oration"
    - "Weeping, and smiting his breast"
    - "Inextinguishable laughter arose among the blessed gods"
  
  PERMITTED:
    - "He smote his breast, and thus reproached his heart,
       Endure, my heart; far worse hast thou endured!"
  
  IMPLEMENTATION:
    IF narrative.depicts(hero.excessive_emotion()):
        REJECT("not conducive to temperance")


RULE_6: NO_INTEMPERANCE OR DISRESPECT

  FORBIDDEN:
    - Disrespect to commanders ("O heavy with wine, who hast
       the eyes of a dog and the heart of a stag")
    - Gluttony praised ("nothing more glorious than when tables
       are full of bread and meat")
    - Gods overcome by lust (Zeus and Hera)
    - Heroes as "lovers of money" (Achilles taking bribes)
  
  PERMITTED:
    - "Friend, sit still and obey my word"
    - "The Greeks marched breathing prowess, in silent awe
       of their leaders"
```

### 5.3 The Content Evaluation Algorithm

```python

## 6. The Lie Typology

Plato distinguishes two kinds of lies with different moral statuses.

### 6.1 True Lie vs. Verbal Lie

```
LIE_TYPOLOGY:

## 7. The Specialization Principle

A foundational constraint on mimetic practice.

### 7.1 The One-Art Rule

```
AXIOM:
  "One man can only do one thing well, and not many;
   and that if he attempt many, he will altogether fail
   of gaining much reputation in any."

APPLICATION_TO_IMITATION:
  "No one man can imitate many things as well as
   he would imitate a single one."

EXAMPLES:
  - Writers of tragedy â‰  writers of comedy (same persons cannot succeed)
  - Rhapsodists â‰  actors
  - Comic actors â‰  tragic actors

### 7.3 The Contagion of Character

```
MECHANISM:
  IF person.imitates(character_type) repeatedly:
    THEN person.becomes(character_type)
  
  "Imitations, beginning in early youth and continuing
   far into life, at length grow into habits and become
   a second nature, affecting body, voice, and mind."

THEREFORE:
  Limit imitation to excellent types only.

## 8. Harmony, Rhythm, and Style Protocol

Plato's prescriptions for musical and metrical elements.

### 8.1 The Compositional Hierarchy

```
HIERARCHY_OF_ELEMENTS:

  WORDS (logoi)
       â†“ determine
  MELODY (harmonia)
       â†“ determines  
  RHYTHM (rhythmos)

PRINCIPLE:
  "Rhythm and harmony are regulated by the words,
   and not the words by them."

IMPLICATION:
  Content (words) has priority over form (music).
  Sound must serve sense.
```

### 8.2 Permitted and Forbidden Harmonies

### 8.3 Instrument Restrictions

```
INSTRUMENT_EVALUATION:

FORBIDDEN:
  - "Many-stringed curiously-harmonised instruments"
  - "Artificers of lyres with three corners and complex scales"
  - Flute ("in this composite use of harmony the flute is
           worse than all the stringed instruments")

PERMITTED:
  - Lyre and harp (in city)
  - Pipe (for shepherds in country)

SYMBOLIC:
  "The preferring of Apollo and his instruments to
   Marsyas and his instruments"
```

### 8.4 The Style-Soul Connection

```
PRINCIPLE:
  "Beauty of style and harmony and grace and good rhythm
   depend on simplicity â€” I mean the true simplicity of a
   rightly and nobly ordered mind and character, not that
   other simplicity which is only an euphemism for folly."

ALGORITHM:
  good_style = f(good_soul)
  good_rhythm = f(good_life)
  harmony = f(character)
  
  THEREFORE:
    To judge style â†’ judge soul that produces it
    To improve style â†’ improve soul
```

## 9. The Psychic Contagion Mechanism

How poetry transmits emotional states from fiction to audience.

### 9.1 The Sympathy Problem

```
OBSERVATION:
  "The best of us, as I conceive, when we listen to a passage
   of Homer, or one of the tragedians, in which he represents
   some pitiful hero who is drawling out his sorrows in a long
   oration, or weeping, and smiting his breast â€” the best of us,
   you know, delight in giving way to sympathy, and are in
   raptures at the excellence of the poet who stirs our
   feelings most."

CONTRADICTION:
  "But when any sorrow of our own happens to us, then you may
   observe that we pride ourselves on the opposite quality â€”
   we would fain be quiet and patient; this is the manly part,
   and the other which delighted us in the recitation is now
   deemed to be the part of a woman."

QUESTION:
  "Now can we be right in praising and admiring another who
   is doing that which any one of us would abominate and be
   ashamed of in his own person?"
```

### 9.2 The Infection Mechanism

```python
def psychic_contagion(audience, narrative):
    """
    How fictional emotions infect real souls.
    """
    
    # Step 1: Natural hunger for emotional release
    natural_desire = """
    When in misfortune we feel a natural hunger and desire
    to relieve our sorrow by weeping and lamentation.
    """
    
    # Step 2: Vicarious satisfaction
    vicarious_release = """
    This feeling which is kept under control in our own
    calamities is satisfied and delighted by the poets.
    """
    
    # Step 3: Guard lowered
    rationalization = """
    The better nature in each of us, not having been
    sufficiently trained by reason or habit, allows the
    sympathetic element to break loose because the sorrow
    is another's; and the spectator fancies that there can
    be no disgrace to himself in praising and pitying any
    one who comes telling him what a good man he is.
    """
    
    # Step 4: Transfer to real life
    contagion = """
    Few persons ever reflect... that from the evil of other
    men something of evil is communicated to themselves.
    And so the feeling of sorrow which has gathered strength
    at the sight of the misfortunes of others is with
    difficulty repressed in our own.
    """
    
    # Applies to all emotions
    extension = """
    The same may be said of lust and anger and all the other

```

### 9.3 The Comedy Parallel

```
THE_RISIBLE_FACULTY:

  OBSERVATION:
    "There are jests which you would be ashamed to make
     yourself, and yet on the comic stage, or indeed in
     private, when you hear them, you are greatly amused
     by them, and are not at all disgusted."
  
  MECHANISM:
    "There is a principle in human nature which is disposed
     to raise a laugh, and this which you once restrained
     by reason, because you were afraid of being thought a
     buffoon, is now let out again."
  
  CONSEQUENCE:
    "Having stimulated the risible faculty at the theatre,
     you are betrayed unconsciously to yourself into playing
     the comic poet at home."

## 11. Diagnostic Questions

### 11.1 Narrative Mode Diagnosis

```
â–¡ Is the poet speaking in his own voice or as a character?
â–¡ If mixed, what is the ratio of narration to impersonation?
â–¡ Does the narrative conceal or reveal the poet's presence?
â–¡ What modes of imitation does it require from performers?
```

### 11.2 Ontological Status Diagnosis

```
â–¡ Is this narrative about Forms, particulars, or images?
â–¡ How many removes from truth is the depicted content?
â–¡ Does the narrative imitate reality or appearance?
â–¡ Does it "lightly touch on a small part" while claiming wholeness?
```

### 11.3 Psychological Target Diagnosis

```
â–¡ Which part of the soul does this narrative address?
â–¡ Does it strengthen reason or passion?
â–¡ Does it feed the "many-headed monster" or the "man within"?
â–¡ Would the audience be ashamed to do in life what they enjoy in fiction?
```

### 11.4 Content Diagnosis

```
â–¡ Are gods depicted as authors of good only?
â–¡ Are gods depicted as unchanging and truthful?
â–¡ Are heroes depicted as temperate and courageous?
â–¡ Does the narrative inspire courage or fear regarding death?
â–¡ Are the wicked shown as happy or the just as miserable?
```

### 11.5 Contagion Risk Diagnosis

```
â–¡ What emotions does this narrative cultivate in audiences?
â–¡ Would repeated exposure strengthen passions or reason?
â–¡ Does it release feelings that should remain controlled?
â–¡ Will the audience carry these emotions into their own lives?
```

```
ONTOLOGY:
  Truth = Forms > Particulars > Images
  Artist = Imitator of appearance (three removes)

PSYCHOLOGY:
  Soul = Reason > Spirit > Appetite
  Mimesis addresses: Appetite (inferior)

KNOWLEDGE:
  User > Maker > Imitator
  Imitator has: neither knowledge nor correct belief

EFFECT:
  Poetry â†’ feeds passions â†’ weakens reason â†’ corrupts soul
```

### Mode Classification

```
DIEGESIS:    Poet visible, no impersonation
MIMESIS:     Poet concealed, full impersonation
MIXED:       Alternation of both
```

### Content Rules (Quick Check)

```
GODS:
  âœ“ Author of good only
  âœ“ Unchanging
  âœ“ Truthful
  âœ— Causing evil

GENERAL:
  âœ“ Just shown as happy
  âœ“ Wicked shown as miserable
  âœ— Wicked shown as happy
  âœ— Just shown as miserable
```

### The Fundamental Test

```
"He who listens to [poetry], fearing for the safety of the
 city which is within him, should be on his guard against
 her seductions and make our words his law."

QUESTION:
  Does this narrative strengthen the "city within"
  (rational governance of the soul) or weaken it
  (letting passions rule)?
  
IF strengthens â†’ ADMIT
IF weakens â†’ EXCLUDE (or consume with protective charm)
```

## Appendix A: The Ancient Quarrel

Plato acknowledges the conflict between his view and poetic tradition:

```
"There is an ancient quarrel between philosophy and poetry;
 of which there are many proofs, such as the saying of
 'the yelping hound howling at her lord,' or of one
 'mighty in the vain talk of fools,' and 'the mob of sages
 circumventing Zeus,' and the 'subtle thinkers who are
 beggars after all'; and there are innumerable other signs
 of ancient enmity between them."
```

This quarrel represents the tension between:
- **Philosophy**: Seeks truth through reason
- **Poetry**: Produces appearances that move emotions

Plato's Republic sides firmly with philosophy, while acknowledging poetry's seductive power: "We are very conscious of her charms."

## Appendix B: Implementation Notes

### For Writers

Plato's framework, though restrictive, offers diagnostic value:

1. **Mode awareness**: Know when you're showing vs. telling
2. **Ontological honesty**: Acknowledge you deal in appearances
3. **Psychological targeting**: Consider which soul-parts you address
4. **Contagion responsibility**: Accept that fiction shapes character

### For Critics

Plato provides a systematic evaluation framework:

1. **Map the ontological level** of representation
2. **Identify the psychological target** of the work
3. **Assess the ethical content** against explicit rules
4. **Evaluate the contagion risk** for audiences

### Limitations

Plato's framework assumes:
- Fixed tripartite soul (contested by later psychology)
- Clear hierarchy of knowledge (contested by epistemology)
- Narrative as moral danger (contested by Aristotle's catharsis)
- State authority over art (contested by liberal aesthetics)

Modern applications should treat Plato's algorithms as diagnostic tools rather than prescriptive mandates.
