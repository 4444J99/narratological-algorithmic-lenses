## MOVEMENT I: OVERTURE (Lines 1-162)
*Function: Visual thesis statement; formal grammar establishment*

### Beat 1.1 — BLACK SCREEN / QUADRANT SETUP (Lines 8-17)
**Location:** Black Screen → Four Quadrants
**Camera:** Title card aesthetic
**Function:** [EXPO] [WORLD]

LOGO appears half-opacity. TIMESTAMP counts toward zero. Screen splits into four quadrants (1L, 1R, 2L, 2R) with static.

**[AESTHETE]:** The logo's indecipherability and the countdown immediately establish stakes and surveillance grammar. We are positioned as watchers of a mediated event.

---

### Beat 1.2 — LI ARRIVES HOME (Lines 18-51)
**Location:** .1L - EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET / HOME
**Camera:** GUTTER CAM, FRONT DOOR CAM
**Function:** [EXPO] [CHAR] [WORLD]

Li (40s, high heels, overcoat) exits hover-car in torrential rain. Fights wind and umbrella to door. Retina-scanned for entry. LAST FEW FRAMES LOOP.

**[WORLD]:** Hover-cars, retina scanning, perpetual storm—future established through texture.
**[AESTHETE]:** The loop introduces the rhythm motif; repetition as entrapment.

*Connector: + (introduces parallel)*

---

### Beat 1.3 — FRE IN BATHROOM (Lines 52-79)
**Location:** .2R - INT. MASTER BATHROOM
**Camera:** CEILING AIR CONDITION DUCT CAM
**Function:** [CHAR] [THEME]

Fre (late 40s, looks 20, pajamas, out of shape) enters bathroom with anti-aging products on both sides of his-and-her sinks. Takes seat on toilet, scrolls phone. Messages other women on social media. Switches to porn. Masturbates. CENSORED. Frames loop in pulse rhythm.

**[THEME]:** Sexuality is the domain of surveillance; even solitary pleasure is observed.
**[CHAR]:** Fre immediately established as pathetic, compulsive, unfaithful.
**[AESTHETE]:** CENSORED as active visual element—the blurred form becomes the subject.

*Connector: + (parallel continues)*

---

### Beat 1.4 — SUS PRACTICES PIROUETTES (Lines 80-109)
**Location:** .1R - INT. DAUGHTER'S BEDROOM
**Camera:** LAPTOP SELFIE CAM
**Function:** [CHAR] [FORE]

Sus (17) in ballet uniform, surrounded by mirrors (infinite reflection), practices pirouettes with earbuds. Counts aloud. Falters at 8, again at 12, succeeds at 15. Brief celebration → immediate sullen withdrawal. Begins undressing. CENSORED. Looped form joins polyrhythm.

**[CHAR]:** Sus established as perfectionist with suppressed emotions; the quick celebration/withdrawal suggests depression or abuse trauma.
**[FORE]:** The stockings, the discipline, the mirrors—setup for Mis Sar thread.

*Connector: + (parallel continues)*

---

### Beat 1.5 — ROK DROPS PHONE / YOGA / VOMITS (Lines 110-139)
**Location:** .2L - INT. SON'S BEDROOM
**Camera:** MOBILE PHONE CAM
**Function:** [CHAR] [FORE]

Phone drops to floor, capturing mirrored wall with images of busty females. Fog fills lens. Rok (teenage boy, shirtless) enters frame, positions phone under himself. Performs yoga poses, body parts out of frame. Suddenly drops to hands and knees, runs O.S., retches three times. Returns to position. LOOP.

**[CHAR]:** Rok immediately pathologized—the vomiting suggests bulimia or extreme weight-cutting for wrestling.
**[FORE]:** The female images vs. the careful self-framing suggest complex sexuality.

*Connector: + → (parallels resolve)*

---

### Beat 1.6 — QUADRANTS SYNC / SIREN (Lines 140-157)
**Location:** All four quadrants
**Camera:** Composite
**Function:** [THEME] [TURN]

Each quadrant beats to own rhythm. Audio creates atonal madness. Clip lengths shift, endings/beginnings align until ALL FOUR SYNC. Audio filters out. Silence. SIREN. Four quadrants DISTORT, MORPH into one widescreen image—all four figures overlaying, flattened, moving in/out of sync.

**[THEME]:** The family is one body, fragmented but connected; their dysfunction is unified.
**[AESTHETE]:** The sync/siren functions as musical resolution—dissonance to consonance to alarm.

FADE OUT. TIMECODE: -08:37:98.

*Connector: → (thesis stated)*

---

### Beat 1.7 — TITLE CARD (Lines 158-162)
**Location:** Black
**Function:** [EXPO]

FADE IN: TITLE: Open View. FADE OUT.

---

## MOVEMENT II: ESTABLISHMENT (Lines 163-850)
*Function: Family dynamics, world rules, affair introductions*

### Beat 2.1 — EXTERIOR SURVEILLANCE OF HOME (Lines 166-199)
**Location:** EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET / NEIGHBOR A / NEIGHBOR B
**Camera:** CAR INTERIOR CAM, MOBILE PHONE CAM, FRONT DOOR CAMERA
**Function:** [WORLD] [THEME]

Three rapid shots: car zips past HOME, takes blurred snapshot → phone user across street takes snapshot → neighbor's door camera spins, captures HOME before leaving frame. All FREEZE FRAME.

**[THEME]:** The house is perpetually photographed from multiple angles—surveillance is environmental, not just interior.
**[WORLD]:** Every device is a camera; every surface is potentially observed.

*Connector: + (establishes surveillance)*

---

### Beat 2.2 — MASTER BEDROOM: DIVORCE ANNOUNCEMENT (Lines 201-321)
**Location:** INT. MASTER BEDROOM
**Camera:** Unspecified (likely ceiling/wall)
**Function:** [INC] [CHAR] [THEME]

Li and Fre on opposite ends of king bed, phones mirrored for viewers. Fre views porn/bloopers; Li's screen static—she mimes usage. Li shifts to get attention; Fre doesn't notice. She says: "We are getting divorced." He doesn't hear. She slaps phone from his hand: "I am leaving you."

Fre's response is mechanical repetition: "We are getting divorced. You are leaving me. I heard you. No need to act like a wild animal."

They negotiate: tell kids tomorrow. Discussion of Lef—Fre: "You wanted him. You get to have him." The conversation reveals history: Fre threatened to leave without another child; now claims he's leaving regardless. Li quotes his mother: "Everywhere you go, there you are."

Brief moment of connection—rolling eyes meet, shared smirk. Li asks him to turn out light. He does.

**[INC]:** The divorce is the surface inciting incident—the story that appears to be starting.
**[CHAR]:** The marriage is dead but functional; they've ritualized their cruelty.
**[RHETORICIAN]:** "Free at last" / "Nothing close to free"—the dialogue operates in call-and-response patterns.

*Connector: + (domestic established)*

---

### Beat 2.3 — HOME EXTERIOR: LIGHTS OUT (Lines 314-321)
**Location:** EXT. HOME - NIGHT
**Camera:** Exterior
**Function:** [EXPO]

Darkness engulfs home. Lights flicker in every room. Master bedroom light shuts off. FADE OUT.

*Connector: + (night passes)*

---

### Beat 2.4 — MORNING ROUTINE: ROK (Lines 324-362)
**Location:** INT. SON'S BEDROOM / BATHROOM
**Camera:** AIR CONDITION CEILING VENT CAM
**Function:** [CHAR] [FORE]

Morning. Rok halts out of bed, drinks dark liquid, drops to floor for plank/pushups under digitally projected sunshine. Records himself with smartphone. Retches in bathroom, spits, brushes teeth, flexes muscles, pinches underarm flesh, slaps himself in face.

**[CHAR]:** The routine reveals pathology—recording workouts, vomiting, self-punishment.
**[FORE]:** "Weigh-in is Friday" (later)—this is athletic weight-cutting behavior.

*Connector: + (parallel morning)*

---

### Beat 2.5 — MORNING ROUTINE: SUS (Lines 364-383)
**Location:** INT. DAUGHTER'S BEDROOM
**Camera:** LAPTOP CAM
**Function:** [CHAR] [THEME]

Sus stares directly through laptop cam. Wide awake, motionless, emotionless. OVERWHELMING CLASSICAL MUSIC plays. Tears well. She almost loses control. A tear rolls down. Long moments pass before she comes to life—sits up, drinks entire water bottle, wipes tears, grits teeth, bites lip.

**[CHAR]:** The morning ritual of suppression—she must actively prevent herself from breaking down.
**[THEME]:** The camera captures what the family cannot see of each other.

*Connector: + (parallel morning)*

---

### Beat 2.6 — MORNING ROUTINE: LI & FRE BATHROOM (Lines 386-579)
**Location:** INT. MASTER BATHROOM
**Camera:** MIRROR LIGHTS SCONCE
**Function:** [CHAR] [EXPO] [THEME]

**2.6a — Beauty Routine (386-407):**
Li and Fre perform anti-aging rituals: dark lotion around eyes shifts to skin tone; spray straightens/dries hair; mousse thickens Fre's hair into geometric shape. They brush teeth. PING.

**2.6b — "Da's kids dead" (408-466):**
Fre reports on phone: "Da's kids dead. Another shooting." Li laughs—"The male?" Fre: "No, the female...when it hits so close to home...kind of scary." Li deflects to "He was always such an asshole."

This triggers the major domestic argument:
- Fre: "Every guy you fucked is an asshole."
- Li: "What does that say about you?"
- Exchange about Li thinking Da is an asshole because she fucked him; Fre thinks he's an asshole because he fucked her
- Li: "We can both agree...we all sometimes are...fucking assholes."

**2.6c — Vegas/Divorce (467-577):**
Fre pushes for timeline: cheap Vegas flights, prices going up. "When are you going to tell them?" Li: "When are WE going to tell them?" Fre: "You." Li: "We." Fre: "I did not know you spoke French." (Li laughs—"pity laugh.")

Fre's outburst: "You know what your problem is? You're an unfuckable cunt. Plain and simple."

Li doesn't react—"I am an unfuckable cunt. You are an unlovable slob. True."

They exchange further insults (premature ejaculation, laziness, coldness). Fre: "You knew what was happening and you didn't try to course correct it?" Li: "I don't think I wanted to."

PING. Fre: "I'm forwarding you the primary schools that Lef has gotten into." Li's eyes sink—wave of dread.

**[RHETORICIAN]:** This is the script's best scene. The dialogue is acidic, rhythmic, revealing. The "pity laugh" exchange shows characters who still share humor despite hatred.
**[THEME]:** The news of a shooting is absorbed and deflected in seconds—violence is ambient.
**[CHAR]:** Li's "I don't think I wanted to" is the most honest moment—she chose not to save the marriage.

*Connector: → (morning ends, day begins)*

---

### Beat 2.7 — BLACK BOX DELIVERY (Lines 581-594)
**Location:** EXT. HOME - CONTINUOUS
**Camera:** FRONT DOOR
**Function:** [INC] [FORE]

Sun fights through rain. TIMECODE: -00:07:37. INSECT DRONE FLASHES into frame, deposits BLACK BOX, flashes out.

**[INC]:** The true inciting incident—the Black Box arrives.
**[FORE]:** The countdown approaches zero; something will activate.

*Connector: → (object delivered)*

---

### Beat 2.8 — KITCHEN: DRUG DISPENSER / BREAKFAST (Lines 597-838)
**Location:** INT. HOME KITCHEN
**Camera:** DRUG DISPENSER, ABOVE THE REFRIGERATOR CAM, various BODY CAMS
**Function:** [EXPO] [CHAR] [WORLD]

**2.8a — Sus takes pills (597-618):**
Sus enters, freezes, retina scanned. PILLS whoosh down dispenser. She swallows with water. DOORBELL RINGS. She gets plate from convection oven, joins Li at glass table. Li has untouched food-pie-chart.

**2.8b — Appetite suppressant (619-626):**
Li (disturbed by Sus eating): "Is the appetite suppressant not working as effectively as before?" Sus takes another bite while maintaining eye contact.

**2.8c — Fre takes pills (627-643):**
Fre warned to remain still, scanned, swallows pills dry, gets food, joins table.

**2.8d — Rok brings Black Box (644-670):**
FRONT DOOR—Rok exits, hesitates, picks up BLACK BOX (heavier than expected), spins it like basketball. Returns to kitchen, places on table. TIMECODE: -00:00:00.

**2.8e — Family breakfast bickering (670-838):**
Fre accuses Li of buying box; she denies ("New Year's resolution to spend less"). Rok/Sus claim innocence. Discussion of Lef's filter change—Sus changed it last, Li: "If you see something, do something."

Sus: "About the divorce?" Rok: "No one cares. We were hoping it'd stick after the first two."

Ride logistics; insults exchanged. Sus accuses Rok of "talking to my tits." Fre: "He's a sixteen year old boy, he can't help himself."

Li: "Everyone make sure you're all home later. We need to talk." "Be home by 6pm or I'll debit your weekly allowance."

Wave of euphoria strikes Sus. Wave of nausea strikes Rok. They leave.

Li turns toward BLACK BOX. FADE OUT.

**[WORLD]:** Drug dispensers with retina scanning; food as pie-chart; weekly allowance debiting—the home is a control system.
**[CHAR]:** The children's non-reaction to divorce reveals this is old news.
**[FORE]:** Timecode hits zero as Black Box placed on table—activation primed.

*Connector: → (family disperses)*

---

### Beat 2.9 — LEF'S GROW TANK / DREAMS (Lines 841-926)
**Location:** INT. HOME - BASEMENT
**Camera:** Various—Lef's heart, body, tank, dream monitor
**Function:** [EXPO] [CHAR] [FORE] [THEME]

Basement door slides open. Blackened room with distant pulsing light. DISSOLVE through: Lef's HEART (fleshy, see-through), Lef's BODY (scaly, yellow, visible tissue/bone), Lef's GROW TANK (floor-to-ceiling liquid vat, zero-year-old toddler floating comatose).

DREAM MONITOR shows: Li/Fre/Lef cuddling in bed; Fre/Lef shaving together (Rok waving in background); Lef falling into darkness; Lef playing piano to applause.

ARM MOVES to swat invisible fly. VITALS: Estimated Time of Arrival: One month.

**[CHAR]:** Lef dreams of inclusion—a family that will never exist.
**[THEME]:** The unborn already knows violence (falling into pit) and aspiration (piano).
**[FORE]:** The tank's vulnerability is established; the temperature will matter.

*Connector: + (world detail)*

---

### Beat 2.10 — FAMILY CAR: DEPARTURE (Lines 928-943)
**Location:** INT. FAMILY CAR
**Camera:** WINDSHIELD CAM
**Function:** [CHAR] [THEME]

Driverless car. Li, Fre, Rok, Sus each absorbed in mobile device. Fre adjusts pants. Li wipes tear. Rok laughs until tears. Sus blows nose. No one notices anyone else.

**[THEME]:** Four bodies in one vehicle, zero connection—screens mediate all experience.

*Connector: + (transition)*

---

## MOVEMENT III: PARALLEL LIVES (Lines 944-1760)
*Function: Character threads develop independently; HQ introduced*

### Beat 3.1 — HQ: CONTROL ROOM INTRODUCTION (Lines 945-959)
**Location:** INT. HQ - CONTROL ROOM
**Camera:** Unspecified
**Function:** [EXPO] [WORLD]

No sign of day or weather. Three connected screen panels with segmented camera footage from all cameras in the film. Center: SILHOUETTED FIGURES in draped clothing, holding glass tablets, crouching and standing, watching screens, taking notes, implementing commands.

**[WORLD]:** The watchers revealed—but kept abstract, silhouetted.
**[DRAMATURGIST]:** First HQ scene establishes surveillance control but provides no character specificity.

*Connector: + (parallel world introduced)*

---

### Beat 3.2 — LI: MCDONALD'S DETOUR (Lines 960-1033)
**Location:** INT. FAMILY CAR / EXT. MCDONALD'S / INT. MCDONALD'S
**Camera:** BACK DRIVER'S HEADREST CAM, FRONT BUMPER CAM, SECURITY CAM, CHECKOUT CAM
**Function:** [CHAR] [REL]

Li in backseat with devices. CAR VOICE: at Burger King, line too long for 2:30 appointment. Reroute to McDonald's. Phone call from "ERV-WORK"—orders 300 square meters, cancels meeting, announces going out of town.

Parks, gets soaked in rain, enters McDonald's.

CHECKOUT VOICE: "Welcome to McDonalds. How can we best fill you today?"

She smiles fully for the first time in a long time.

**[CHAR]:** The McDonald's visit is unexplained—an errand? A meeting? The smile is striking after morning's cruelty.
**[FIRST-READER]:** The "best fill you" phrasing is odd—future slang? Sexual innuendo?

*Connector: + (parallel thread)*

---

### Beat 3.3 — FRE: PORN INTERRUPTED / NOL AFFAIR (Lines 1035-1117)
**Location:** INT. FRE'S DRAWING ROOM
**Camera:** FRE'S BODY CAM, TABLET CAM, BIRD'S EYE CAM
**Function:** [CHAR] [THEME]

Fre at DESK TABLET, summons 3D geometric shapes—architectural work (plumbing, electrical). Pauses. Swipes to BROWSER, summons PORN in large renderings. CENSORED.

PING. Porn audio cuts, censor disappears. Door slides open.

NOL enters (younger woman), lingers by doorway, approaches, spits on floor: "Out of breath? You're a pig. Can't control yourself. Good for nothing."

They circle each other like animals. Fre: "Shut up, cunt." (spits back)

Nol: "How's your wife?" Fre: "Good. We're getting divorced." "Whose idea?" "Mine. But I made her think it was hers."

Nol lets hair down. Fre pounces, grabs her. She pushes away: "For you." His shoulders sink. She grabs him tighter, shoves tongue in mouth. They fall out of frame.

**[CHAR]:** Fre's pattern: work → porn → caught by mistress. The dynamic is combative/degrading.
**[THEME]:** Surveillance is total—even his affair begins with PING, door opening automatically.

*Connector: + (parallel thread)*

---

### Beat 3.4 — SUS: BALLET PRACTICE / MIS SAR (Lines 1120-1247)
**Location:** INT. SUS' STUDIO / INT. MIS SAR'S OFFICE
**Camera:** SUS BODY CAM, various mobile cams, HIGH ANGLE SECURITY CAM, SURVEILLANCE CAM
**Function:** [CHAR] [FORE] [THEME]

**3.4a — Pirouette practice (1120-1138):**
Sus pirouettes in front of mirror with barre, body cam spinning. Counts to twenty. Other girls stretch and bullshit around her.

In back, the only figure in black: MIS SAR (older, glowing with forced youth) comes into focus, watching over Sus's shoulder. Sus makes quick eye contact, retreats to floor.

**3.4b — "Almost perfect" (1139-1182):**
Mis Sar approaches, whispers: "Almost perfect. Always just almost."

Sus: "Barely one mistake."

Mis Sar watches, clenched lips. Eyes shift to other girls in mirror. Other ballerinas catch glimpses of Mis Sar hovering.

Mis Sar (whispers): "In my office."

Sus takes moment, then walks toward office. Other girls congregate, whisper, stare.

**3.4c — Office/Stretch (1183-1247):**
Sus sits in office, closes eyes. Mis Sar enters, stands behind, rubs shoulders: "Time to stretch up."

Sus rolls hands from shoulders: "I'm stretched fine."

"My stars stretch." (points to floor)

Sus lies down, faces ceiling. Mis Sar hovers over body, breathing heavy: "Where should we start?"

Sus: "My temples."

Mis Sar leans over entire body, reaches toward thighs... hovers... then grips with tight claws. Sus squeals.

"You will be a star." Mis Sar massages legs.

**[CHAR]:** The dynamic is unmistakably abusive—predatory touch framed as professional "stretching."
**[FORE]:** This thread is introduced but never resolved in current draft.
**[THEME]:** Surveillance everywhere except where it matters—the abuse happens in the office, on the security cam.

*Connector: + (parallel thread)*

---

### Beat 3.5 — ROK: WRESTLING MATCH / EM / GRE (Lines 1250-1369)
**Location:** INT. SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM / INT. LOCKER ROOM
**Camera:** GYM CEILING INTERCOM CAM, CROWD MOBILE PHONE CAMs, ROK BODY CAM
**Function:** [CHAR] [FORE]

**3.5a — Match vs. Gre (1250-1283):**
Under harsh gym lights, Rok and GRE wrestle. Small crowd watches. Multiple phone angles capture the match. Rok pinned, exerts final will, flips pin, wins.

Rok and Gre butt heads and embrace: "Gee gee." Gre's embrace ends quickly; Rok's lingers a second too long.

Gre hustles off. Rok watches him.

**3.5b — Em approaches (1286-1332):**
EM (teenage girl) breaks from crowd: "It's always terrifying and thrilling—and hot—to watch that. You're gonna die early, moron."

Rok: "Not with these quads. Large quadriceps keep you alive longer."

Em: "I can do pushups. Real pushups. No knees. Probably ten."

Rok brushes dust off shoulder: "I'm feeling a puke coming on. Weigh in is on Friday."

Kisses Em on cheek, backs away smiling: "See you soon?"

He hustles toward locker room.

**3.5c — Locker room / Gre (1336-1369):**
Rok catches Gre changing. Gre stares directly into body cam. Rok turns away.

Rok: "What're you doing after this?" Gre (monotone): "Meeting with Se."

Rok: "You play the new expansion of S.E.T. yet?" Gre: "I don't play games. I haven't played games in years."

Rok closes locker, leans exasperated arm against it.

**[CHAR]:** Rok's lingering embrace with Gre, combined with his awkwardness with Em, suggests suppressed or confused sexuality.
**[FORE]:** Thread introduced but never resolved—does the Black Box weaponize this?

*Connector: + (parallel thread)*

---

### Beat 3.6 — HQ: QUEEN'S LOUNGE / WOT & JRA (Lines 1372-1407)
**Location:** INT. HQ - QUEEN'S LOUNGE
**Camera:** Unspecified
**Function:** [EXPO] [WORLD]

WOT (older, wears age unlike others—the boss) and JRA (younger successor) face off. Wot surrounded by screens.

WOT: "Was Series B the right one?"
JRA: "It was a one." / "It's not what I would've chosen necessarily."
WOT: "Series A could be just as effective."
JRA: "Series B could be too."
WOT: "How do you chose?"

FADE OUT.

**[WORLD]:** Series A vs. Series B—the family is an experiment selected from options.
**[DRAMATURGIST]:** Dialogue is too abstract; provides no actionable information.

*Connector: + (HQ thread)*

---

### Beat 3.7 — HQ: CONTROL ROOM / LON INTRODUCED (Lines 1410-1435)
**Location:** INT. HQ - CONTROL ROOM
**Camera:** BEHIND THE SHOULDERS
**Function:** [CHAR] [FORE]

Women working. Door opens, yellow light crashes in. Heads turn. Rush of new women leave, few stay. Quick chaos.

DIP TO BLACK. CAMERA AWAKENS.

The eye of LON—"she's here to burn it down."

She leaves frame. Women working in background. Door opens once more.

**[CHAR]:** Lon's introduction is purely visual/atmospheric—no dialogue, no action beyond entering.
**[FORE]:** "Here to burn it down" promises sabotage that doesn't materialize in current draft.

*Connector: + (HQ thread)*

---

### Beat 3.8 — LI: AFFAIR WITH DEF / VIOLENCE (Lines 1437-1528)
**Location:** EXT./INT. NEW CONSTRUCTION HOME
**Camera:** FRONT DOOR SECURITY CAM, LI'S BODY CAM, BIRD'S EYE CAM, ABOVE THE FRIDGE
**Function:** [CHAR] [TURN] [THEME]

Li walks up to unfinished home with DEF (middle-aged, large jaw/build). He presents house, hand on her back... grabs her ass... whispers in ear... spins her around, kisses.

She untwirls, pulls them into kitchen. From behind, he wraps her up. She pushes off with graceful force. He grabs her hand, shoves it into crotch. She unzips, masturbates him.

Li: "Have you ever loved your wife?"
Def: "For three minutes, maybe once or twice."
Li: "We're disgusting."

He covers her mouth. Li shoves Def—he falls to floor, grinning.

**The violence:**
Li kicks Def in face with sharp boot heel. Pulls back, nails him in gut.

Def (wailing, bloody): "Meet again next week to finalize the kitchen tiling pattern?"

Li: "I'll be on vacation."

She starts to leave, then charges—lurches over him, drives heel into face. He squirms. Neither helps.

Li composes herself. Fixes hair. Straightens clothes. Smiles. Exits.

**[CHAR]:** Li's violence is shocking, unexplained, and suggests hidden depths—is she practicing? Releasing rage? Already an operative?
**[TURN]:** This beat reveals Li is not the victim she appeared; she's capable of extreme violence.
**[THEME]:** The affair is transactional; the violence is personal.

*Connector: → (Li's hidden capacity revealed)*

---

### Beat 3.9 — HQ: REACTION TO LI (Lines 1531-1541)
**Location:** INT. HQ - QUEEN'S LOUNGE
**Camera:** Unspecified
**Function:** [CHAR]

Jra points to screen behind Wot.

JRA: "Didn't see that coming."
WOT: "We didn't see her coming at all."

**[DRAMATURGIST]:** The HQ characters react to Li's violence—suggesting she's surprising them, not following script. This implies Li may be an agent of chaos, not just a subject.

*Connector: + (HQ reaction)*

---

### Beat 3.10 — FRE: NOL DUMPS HIM (Lines 1544-1620)
**Location:** INT. FRE'S DRAWING ROOM
**Camera:** TABLET SELFIE CAM, BIRD'S EYE CAM, FRE'S BODY CAM
**Function:** [CHAR]

Fre and Nol in business chair. Fre pets Nol: "Runaway with me. You hate your husband."

Nol: "Who doesn't hate their husband?" (gets up)

Fre on knees, wrapping arms around her legs: "It would be romantic."

Nol: "Like how this is romantic?"

He falls to fetal position, whimpers: "A grande gesture. We could fly to the desert... walk around without soaked shoes... could start new."

Nol: "You're a moron. Your cloud is going to follow you wherever you go."

Fre: "If I'm a moron, what's that say about you?"

Nol: "It says God really wants me to have your kids."

Fre: "My idea of a vacation has no kids anywhere near it."

Nol: "You're out. Strike three. This is your third time pulling this."

Fre crouch, barely holding together. Nol lingers by doorway.

Fre: "Doesn't this mean anything?"

Nol: "Nothing will mean anything one day."

Fre: "But it does today."

**[CHAR]:** Fre is rejected by his mistress in the same pattern as his marriage—unable to offer anything but escape fantasies.
**[THEME]:** "Nothing will mean anything one day"—nihilism as the operating system of this world.

*Connector: + (Fre's thread reaches nadir)*

---

### Beat 3.11 — LON WATCHES HQ / WOT-JRA CONFRONTATION (Lines 1622-1672)
**Location:** INT. HQ - LON'S QUARTERS
**Camera:** Tablet screens
**Function:** [CHAR] [FORE]

Lon watches feeds on tablet. Cuts between HQ compound footage. LOOPS Control Room selection. Opens Queen's Lounge footage:

JRA: "Didn't see that coming."
WOT: "We didn't see her coming at all."

As Li leaves kitchen, Wot spins back to Jra.

WOT: "You still haven't given me an answer."

Jra takes time. Behind clenched teeth: "You're not going to like my answer."

WOT: "Of course I won't."

Jra bites tongue, turns to floor: "This has been one huge mistake."

WOT: "You think so?"

Eyes locked.

JRA: "We know so."

Wot smiles.

**[CHAR]:** Internal HQ conflict—Jra believes the experiment is a mistake; Wot continues anyway.
**[FORE]:** Lon is positioned as observer of this conflict—potential saboteur accessing internal disagreement.

*Connector: + (HQ internal tension)*

---

### Beat 3.12 — SUS: METRO / BALLERINA CONFRONTATION (Lines 1675-1730)
**Location:** INT. METRO
**Camera:** METRO SECURITY CAM
**Function:** [CHAR] [TENS]

Sus in foreground reading tablet, keeping to herself. Background: group of ballerinas in merriment—one flags on pole, another strikes Arabesque.

Sus stands, mirrors Arabesque. Group eggs on competition. Other ballerina falters. Sus holds perfect position longer and longer.

Group approaches. One shoves Sus off pose; she falls to seat.

SHORT BALLERINA: "We're coming for your star. You can't keep on top forever."

Sus shoves Short Ballerina back. Group gasps, tends to "wounds."

Sus sits: (whispers) "You'll never be as good as me."

LANKY BALLERINA: "How do we get into those special appointments with you and the Mis?"

SIDEBURNS BALLERINA: "Maybe someone needs to die."

MOLE BALLERINA: "Kill Caesar."

Metro halts. Ballerinas laugh, some leave. Remaining sit across from Sus, uneasy eye contact.

**[CHAR]:** Sus's isolation is not accidental—the other girls know about Mis Sar and resent her for it.
**[THEME]:** The abuse is semi-public; everyone suspects but no one intervenes.

*Connector: + (Sus's isolation deepened)*

---

### Beat 3.13 — HQ: WOT-JRA FACE MASKS (Lines 1733-1759)
**Location:** INT. HQ - QUEEN'S LOUNGE
**Camera:** Unspecified
**Function:** [CHAR]

Wot offers hand for shaking. Jra denies. Wot retreats, forms steeple with hands. Jra leans forward, hands tucked—ready to pounce.

WOT: "It's going to be one of those?"

Jra hesitates. Unclips one side of face mask, then other—drops to floor. Pulls off headdress, slides to ground.

JRA: "Something like one of those."

**[CHAR]:** Jra removes mask—symbolic vulnerability or rebellion? The unmasking suggests willingness to be seen.
**[DRAMATURGIST]:** This is the HQ subplot's most dramatic moment, but it doesn't connect to family action.

*Connector: + (HQ tension peaks)*

**Location:** EXT. SCHOOL

**Function:** [CHAR]

Rok exits school, sees Em reading tablet under awning. Checks time on phone, hesitates, settles across from her on opposite bench.

EM: "Waiting for the bus."
ROK: "Waiting for Li."

Long pause.

EM: "You don't like me do you?"
ROK: "Who knows what I like? Do you know what you like?"
EM: "I know I like you."
ROK: "Kid's don't solve anything, don't you know that."
EM: "They could, if you let them."
ROK: "I don't want to let them."
EM: "You're a virgin, right?"
ROK: "Yeah, so, who isn't?"

Em nods she's a virgin too.

ROK: "I'm not trying to get married today, I'm not trying to have kids tomorrow. Especially not with you."
EM: "You don't need to be so mean about it."
ROK: "You made me be mean."
EM: "I didn't make you do anything."
ROK: "You don't know anything about me."

Em wounded. Rok starts toward her to console, decides against it, turns to face empty rainy parking lot.

**[CHAR]:** Rok's cruelty masks confusion—he doesn't know what he likes. The sexuality question is deflected.
**[THEME]:** "Kids don't solve anything"—Rok rejecting the family model while trapped in it.

*Connector: + (Rok's isolation)*

Sus walks down street, earbuds equipped, eyes closed. Rain on her face. Calm. For one beat, she dances along to music we can't hear.

**Location:** EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET / EXT. HOME

Li stops. Expression grows somber, silent, disturbed.

Rok reaches for phone, sees same news. Eyes confused, then widened and scared.

He looks to Li for advice/hope.

Without eye contact, she returns to window.

Li: "Close the window."

**[CHAR]:** Li's non-response to Rok's fear—she doesn't comfort or explain. Her coldness is total.
**[THEME]:** "It's always raining"—environmental/emotional collapse as permanent state.

Water shows movement. Body contorts, jerks randomly.

DOOR CHIME. Li and Rok names remain greyed; Fre and Sus names now white.

BATHROOM DOORS SLIDE CLOSED and LOCKED.

Tank temperature increased further. WARNINGS blink. Heart rate steadily increases.

Water bubbles become violent.

Fre stares at screen, reaches to adjust settings—nothing changeable. Confused, then angry, then aggressive with hands.

Sus comes down, joins Fre's side. Stares into tank, mouth agape.

Lef writhes in pain.

FRE: "It's unstoppable. I can't control it."

Sus reaches to touch tank, recoils from heat.

FRE: "Why do you say what?"

**Location:** INT. HOME - FOYER
**Camera:** Unspecified
**Function:** [TENS] [CRIS]

Li and Rok pass threshold from exterior to interior—

FRONT DOOR SLIDES SHUT VIOLENTLY, CLIPPING ROK'S FOOT.

Rok falls, screams, reaches for Li: "Help."

Li turns back, continues for a second, pauses, then returns—on hands and knees helps Rok pull foot free from door.

She embraces him from behind, foot on door, foot on wall, uses leg strength to pull.

She pulls—he wails in agony: "Stop!"

Li: "Help with your other foot."

They both push and scream—one in pain, one in might.

Rok liberated. His heel destroyed.

Door opens wider, then slides shut, locking.

Rok holds onto Li, weeping. She embraces him, expression blank.

Li: "Good boy. Good boy. Good boy. Hush now. Settle down. Hush. Do you think you can walk?"

Rok nods.

They stand together, he leans on her shoulder.

Li: "Good boy. Good job. Keep up the good work."

They move to basement door, frame emitting BRIGHT LIGHT.

They descend, disappear.

BASEMENT DOOR CLOSES, LOCKS BEHIND THEM.

**[CRIS]:** The house has drawn blood—the trap is closed.
**[CHAR]:** Li's response ("Good boy" repetition) is maternal but hollow—conditioned response without feeling.

*Connector: → (family trapped in basement)*

---

**Location:** EXT. HOME - NIGHT
**Camera:** Exterior
**Function:** [TENS]

### Beat 4.10 — LEF'S DEATH (Lines 2237-2395)
**Location:** INT. HOME - BASEMENT
**Camera:** LEF'S VITALS, BODY, various
**Function:** [CLIM] [THEME]

BLACK SCREEN. Audio fades in: heavy breathing, panting, sobbing.

LEF'S VITALS: Temperature crawls up to maximum extremes.

LEF'S BODY: Water boils. Lef writhes, jerks, sputters, seizing—not occasionally, but rapidly.

Li helps Rok hobble down. Throws Rok off shoulder, hurries to Fre and Sus.

LI: "What have you done?"
FRE: "I'm trying to save him."
LI: "Let me see."

Li pushes Fre aside. He looks at tank, sees Lef, sees Sus on knees with hands to face—pushes Li to floor with all might.

FRE: "I'll save my son."

Sus stands stoic, beginning to block it out.

Lef's extremities whack glass with dull thud.

Rok far back, crying about wound, not registering.

Lef's head bangs glass. Milky red eyes shoot open wide.

Rok's eyes shoot open—now aware.

Rok sucks on hands, drooling.

Sus backs away slowly.

Li ignores Lef, runs to slap Rok across face.

LI: "Pull yourself together."

Body twists, contorts. Blood shoots from orifices. Skin loosens, peels back.

Sus watches Lef's Dream Screen: someone being tortured.

LI: "It's too late."
FRE: "It's not too late."
LI: "He's dead."
FRE: "He's not dead yet. We can help him if we can stop whatever is happening from continuing."
LI: "It's too late."
FRE: (to Sus) "Go reset the power in the garage."

Sus doesn't respond, then does—runs upstairs, tries door, locked.

SUS: "I can't get out of the basement."

LI: "You didn't want another kid anyway. So at least another bird is taken care of."

FRE: "You're the one who didn't want the kid. I just want to go on vacation once in a while. I just need a break once in a while. A wife who loves and fucks me. Kids who care."

ROK: "Someone get me some opiates. Please."

FRE: "We're locked down here."

ROK: "Call an ambulance. Or the cops."

LI: "Why is this and everything else always about you?"

ROK: "My foot is smashed in half."

LI: "Not you...well, you, a little."

FRE: "Because I'm half dead and it's allowed to be about me."

LI: "Is it allowed to be about me too?"

ROK: "What about me?"

ALARM SETTLES.

HEART RATE nil—machine emits low dull hum, builds, blinks out.

LONG MOMENT of exchanged silence.

LIGHT in stairs IGNITES.

DOOR SLIDES OPEN.

DISTANT AUDIO: multitude of WOMEN'S VOICES, muffled.

SOUND like VIOLENT MICROPHONE FEEDBACK.

AUDIO CUTS ENTIRELY.

INAUDIBLE FREQUENCY causes everyone to convulse, cover ears, SCREAM.

Li and Sus run out.

Fre hops over Rok, rushes out.

Rok crawls out on all fours.

**[CLIM]:** Lef's death is the script's emotional climax—horrifying, protracted, witnessed by family unable to intervene.
**[THEME]:** "Another bird taken care of"—Li's coldness suggests possible complicity. The family argues over who the tragedy is "about" while it's happening.
**[CHAR]:** Each family member responds characteristically: Fre tries to fix; Li gives up; Sus dissociates; Rok focuses on own pain.

*Connector: → (death complete, new phase)*

## MOVEMENT V: GAME (Lines 2396-2810) [INCOMPLETE]
*Function: Black Box issues ultimatum; family separates; moral choices*

### Beat 5.1 — BLACK BOX ULTIMATUM (Lines 2397-2461)
**Location:** INT. HOME - KITCHEN
**Camera:** OVER THE SHOULDER
**Function:** [TENS] [EXPO]

Audio slowly fades back.

Family at kitchen table. Haggard. Worse for wear.

Holographic versions of Silhouetted Women from before appear.

Women speak as CHORUS of FEMALE VOICES, repeating on LOOP, counting down:

BLACK BOX: "We force families apart that should never be put back together again. You are to be splayed, weighed, and displayed. Go to your rooms. Seven."

LI: "I don't think we should be sitting here when the box says one."

Li gets up, lingers. Others don't break eye contact with box.

BLACK BOX: [repeat] "...Six."

ROK: "No one is helping me."

Rok reaches for mother—ignored. Reaches for sister—brushed off.

BLACK BOX: [repeat] "...Five."

SUS: "The doors must be open."

Sus follows mother.

BLACK BOX: [repeat] "...Four."

FRE: (yelling after Li) "Are we supposed to share a room?"

Fre helps Rok up. They hurry off frame.

**[EXPO]:** The Black Box reveals its purpose: forcing family apart, display. The countdown creates urgency.
**[THEME]:** "Splayed, weighed, and displayed"—the family as specimen, spectacle.

*Connector: → (game setup)*

### Beat 5.3 — FRE/ROK STRUGGLE (Lines 2487-2560) [PARTIAL]
**Location:** INT. HOME - UPSTAIRS HALL / INT. SON'S BEDROOM / INT. MASTER BEDROOM
**Camera:** Various
**Function:** [TENS]

Down the hall and into stairway—O.S. sounds of Rok and Fre struggling.

FRE: "You need to help yourself a little bit. You're not dead yet."

Heads emerge, then bodies, then they're in hall.

ROK: "You don't understand how much this hurts."
FRE: "You're like a block of concrete."
ROK: "What's going to happen if we don't make it?"
FRE: "We're going to make it."
ROK: "I don't think we are."

Fre tosses son into bedroom.

Rok falls, slides across floor. Door closes almost trapping other foot.

Fre sprints down hall. Master bedroom door slides closed before he reaches it.

He crashes into door. Crashes again. Falls to floor.

Li watches through door. Eyes widen. Back cocks as Fre hits door. She almost gets off bed.

Fre, back on floor, stomps heels and throws fists in tantrum.

SCREAM BUILDS.

**[TENS]:** Fre fails to make it to his room—trapped in hall. The game's first casualty?

*Connector: → (Fre separated)*

### Beat 5.4 — FRE TO COUCH / CHILDREN ON TV (Lines 2561-2602)
**Location:** INT. HOME - KITCHEN / LIVING ROOM / MASTER BEDROOM
**Camera:** FRE'S BODY CAM, TELEVISION CAM, LI'S BODY CAM
**Function:** [TENS] [THEME]

DISSOLVE TO:

Fre reunited with Black Box in kitchen.

BLACK BOX: "Bad boy. You get to sleep on the couch tonight."

LIVING ROOM: Wall-size television comes to life.

Fre stumbles into living room, eyes and mouth agape.

FRE'S BODY CAM: Television split in half—one feed of Sus's bedroom, one of Rok's bedroom.

TELEVISION CAM: Fre, disturbed, slowly lowers onto couch to watch.

MASTER BEDROOM: Lights go out. Television comes on. Li spins toward light.

Television halved with feeds from Sus and Rok's bedrooms.

LI'S BODY CAM: Li's face painted with screen light, mouth tightly woven.

**[THEME]:** Parents forced to watch children in their bedrooms—surveillance inverted, weaponized. The private space is now public.
**[FIRST-READER]:** The disturbing implication: what will parents be forced to witness?

*Connector: → (surveillance game begins)*

---

### Beat 5.5 — HQ: WOT/JRA EXCHANGE (Lines 2604-2630)
**Location:** INT. HQ - CONTROL ROOM
**Camera:** Unspecified
**Function:** [EXPO]

Wot tests Jra.

WOT: "So what's the next move?"

Jra hesitates.

WOT: "You so sure you're ready for a mutiny."

JRA: "It's obvious the woman live. The woman live for now on."

WOT: "Only men?"

JRA: "Only men."

WOT: "I guess we will see. You doubt a male's sex drive."

**[EXPO]:** The game is gender-based—women survive, men may not. The "sex drive" comment suggests manipulation through desire.
**[DRAMATURGIST]:** This is the clearest statement of the game's rules—too late, too abstract.

*Connector: + (HQ thread)*

---

### Beat 5.6 — CHILDREN IN ROOMS / DISCOVERIES (Lines 2632-2780) [INCOMPLETE]
**Location:** INT. SON'S BEDROOM / BATHROOM / DAUGHTER'S BEDROOM / BATHROOM
**Camera:** Various
**Function:** [TENS] [CRIS]

**5.6a — Rok's tantrum / discovery (2632-2690):**
Rok tantrums like father. Pulls himself together, crawls onto bed.

Emerges all strength he was missing, hops off bed O.S.

Hustles across to bathroom door, off balance and hobbling, crashes into door.

SON'S BATHROOM: GRE (in wrestling uniform) is hog-tied, sealed in floor-to-ceiling standup shower.

Gre yells for help.

Sink turns on. Toilet flushes.

Rok bangs door: "Who is in there?"

**5.6b — Sus's discovery (2694-2706):**
Sus's room has grown much hotter—heater turned on by itself.

She sweats. Folds messy laundry. Notices something.

Walks around surveilling room. Inspects this and that.

Bathroom door slides open. Curiosity brings her in.

DAUGHTER'S BATHROOM: MIS SAR lies unconscious, naked, locked in Sus's shower.

**5.6c — Black Box instructions (2707-2744):**
BLACK BOX (V.O.): "There are decisions to be made. And mom and dad won't always be around to take care of you."

"You've been the victim at the hands of someone who holds power over you."

*Script note (line 2717): "They make them turn on each other, to fulfill a desire. But whoever decides to turn first it is turned against them and they are the one killed."*

BLACK BOX: "An opportunity presents itself. When our needs are selfish, we hurt the ones we love. Your brother must suffer, again, for you to get your revenge."

BLACK BOX (to Rok): "An opportunity presents itself. When our needs are primal, we hurt the ones we love. Your sister must suffer for you to fulfill your lust."

BLACK BOX: "How do you decide?"

ROK: "I decide."

**[CRIS]:** The moral dilemma: Sus can get revenge on abuser (Mis Sar) at cost to brother; Rok can fulfill desire (for... Gre? Sus?) at cost to sister. Whoever chooses first loses.
**[DRAMATURGIST]:** This is the script's structural climax point—but sketched rather than dramatized. The choices need expansion.

*Connector: → (choices presented)*

### Beat 5.7 — PARENTS WATCHING / CHOICES MADE (Lines 2746-2782) [INCOMPLETE]

DAUGHTER'S BATHROOM: Sus pushes her button.

SON'S BATHROOM: Rok hustles inside, embraces Gre (just coming to). Shower door closes behind him. Water starts to fill.

DAUGHTER'S BATHROOM: "Revenge." Mis Sar isn't really there?

**[CLIM]:** Rok chooses to save Gre (fulfilling... what desire?). Sus chooses revenge (which apparently fails—illusion?).
**[DRAMATURGIST]:** The resolution is sketched—"Mis Sar isn't really there?" suggests the game is rigged, choices illusory. Needs clarification.

*Connector: → (consequences begin)*

### Beat 5.8 — FRE TRICKED / DRUGGED (Lines 2784-2793) [INCOMPLETE]
**Location:** INT. HOME - LIVING ROOM
**Camera:** Unspecified
**Function:** [COMP]

Fre gets tricked into thinking one of the women are attracted to him and will save him.

He agrees to kill his wife.

They convince him to take his medication.

He is drugged.

*Connector: + (Fre compromised)*

---

### Beat 5.9 — LON'S SABOTAGE / LI'S REVEAL (Lines 2794-2810) [INCOMPLETE]
**Location:** INT. HQ - LON'S QUARTERS / INT. HOME - LIVING ROOM / INT. MASTER BEDROOM
**Camera:** Various
**Function:** [TURN]

LIVING ROOM: Fre confused—just received two different types of information.

MASTER BEDROOM: Li starts to panic. Reaches out to camera revealing herself to be in on the whole plan.

LON'S QUARTERS: She blocks Li from contacting them.

**[TURN]:** Multiple revelations: Lon is sabotaging from within HQ; Li was complicit in the plan all along. The script ends mid-revelation.
**[DRAMATURGIST]:** SCRIPT TERMINATES. The third act structure (crisis → climax → resolution) is absent.
