# The South Park "But/Therefore" Rule: A Complete Craft Analysis

Every story beat must earn its place through causation, not mere succession. This single principle—articulated by Trey Parker and Matt Stone in 2011—has become one of the most influential and practical storytelling tools of the past two decades. The technique states that if the words "and then" fit between your story beats, **"you're fucked,"** as Matt Stone bluntly put it. What should connect every beat is either "BUT" (introducing conflict or complication) or "THEREFORE" (showing consequence). This creates the causal chain that transforms a sequence of events into an actual story.

The technique matters because it operationalizes thousands of years of narrative theory into a simple diagnostic test any writer can apply in seconds. Aristotle condemned "episodic" plots in 335 BCE; E.M. Forster distinguished "story" from "plot" through causation in 1927; Robert McKee built his screenwriting empire on progressive complications. Parker and Stone distilled all of this into three words that fit on a whiteboard.

## Part 1: The primary source and original articulation

### The NYU lecture: September-October 2011

The technique was first publicly articulated during an MTVU "Stand In" episode filmed at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts. Parker and Stone appeared as surprise guest lecturers in Professor Ken Liotti's mandatory freshman course, "Story-Telling Strategies." The episode was recorded in September 2011 and aired October 3, 2011, across **750+ college campuses**.

**Trey Parker's exact words:**

> "We found out this really simple rule that maybe you guys have all heard before, but it took us a long time to learn it. We can take these beats, which are basically the beats of your outline, and if the words 'and then' belong between those beats, you're fucked. Basically. You've got something pretty boring."

> "What should happen between every beat that you've written down, is either the word 'therefore' or 'but'. So what I'm saying is that you come up with an idea, and it's like 'so this happens' right? 'And then this happens,' no no no no. It should be 'this happens, and therefore this happens. But this happens, therefore this happens.'"

> "Literally we'll sometimes write it out to make sure we're doing it. We'll have our beats, and we'll say, 'okay this happens, but then this happens' and that affects this and that does to that, and that's why you get a show that feels like this to that and this to that but this, here's the complication, to that."

**Matt Stone reinforced the point with characteristic directness:**

> "Fuck that. I see movies, fuck man, you see movies where you're just watching, and it's like this happens and then this happens, and this happens—that's when you're in a movie and you're going 'what the fuck am I watching this movie for?' It's just like this happened, and then this happened, and then this happens—that's not a movie. That's not a story. Like Trey says it's those two, 'but,' 'because,' 'therefore' that gives you the causation between each beat, and that's a story."

### The documentary formulation: "6 Days to Air"

Six days after the NYU episode aired, the documentary "6 Days to Air: The Making of South Park" premiered on Comedy Central (October 9, 2011). Director Arthur Bradford captured the complete production cycle of the Season 15 premiere "HumancentiPad." Here, Parker articulated the technique as a revision principle:

> "I always call it **The Rule of Replacing 'Ands' with Either 'Buts' or 'Therefores.'** So it's always like, This happens AND this happens, AND then this happens... When I can go back and write it and change that to, This happens, THEREFORE this happens, BUT this happens—whenever you can replace your 'ands' with 'buts' or 'therefores'—it makes for better writing."

This framing reveals something crucial: the technique is not just a planning tool but a **revision diagnostic**. When a script isn't working, Parker goes back and hunts for "ands" to replace.

## Part 2: South Park episode analysis

### The watershed moment: "Scott Tenorman Must Die" (S5E4)

This 2001 episode marked a turning point in South Park's storytelling approach. Parker has explicitly identified it as their breakthrough:

> "I remember 'Scott Tenorman Must Die,' it was actually, for us it's a big milestone in 'South Park' only because it was the first time we realized, maybe we're trying to do too much in episodes. And it was the first time that we're like, 'wow, there's really not a C story in this.' We've just got this one A story of Cartman versus this guy. And it turned out so good that we really, from then on, started saying, 'let's forget B stories, let's forget C stories, let's just do a really well told A story.'"

**Causal chain breakdown:**

1. Cartman buys pubes from Scott Tenorman for $10
2. **BUT** he discovers you're supposed to grow your own (he was scammed)
3. **THEREFORE** Cartman demands his money back
4. **BUT** Scott refuses and humiliates him publicly
5. **THEREFORE** Cartman escalates to revenge schemes
6. **BUT** Scott outsmarts him at every turn
7. **THEREFORE** Cartman develops an increasingly elaborate plan
8. **BUT** Stan and Kyle betray Cartman by warning Scott
9. **THEREFORE** Cartman anticipates this betrayal and plans accordingly
10. **THEREFORE** At the chili cook-off, Cartman's multi-layered revenge unfolds

Each beat causes the next. Nothing happens randomly. The episode's power comes entirely from this relentless causal escalation.

### A complete model: "Make Love Not Warcraft" (S10E8)

This Emmy-winning episode demonstrates both the A-story chain and how subplots integrate through causation:

**Main plot:**
1. The boys play World of Warcraft online
2. **BUT** a griefer kills them repeatedly
3. **THEREFORE** they gather all friends to fight back
4. **BUT** the griefer defeats them all
5. **THEREFORE** Cartman convinces them to train obsessively
6. **THEREFORE** they level up over weeks
7. **THEREFORE** they confront the griefer again
8. **BUT** he's still too powerful

**Randy subplot (causally interlinked):**
- Stan dismisses Randy's ability to understand the game
- **THEREFORE** Randy creates a character to prove him wrong
- **BUT** Randy dies immediately to the griefer
- **THEREFORE** Randy quits
- **BUT** Blizzard needs someone to deliver a legendary weapon and can only find Randy
- **THEREFORE** Randy re-enters the game
- **THEREFORE** Randy delivers the Sword of a Thousand Truths to Stan
- **THEREFORE** the boys defeat the griefer

The subplot doesn't exist independently—it directly causes the resolution of the main plot.

### How causation enables 6-day production

South Park's notorious production schedule—creating an episode in roughly **six days** with a staff of 70 working 100-120 hours—would be impossible without structural discipline. The but/therefore technique provides this in several ways:

- **Immediate diagnosis**: If you can't connect beats with "but" or "therefore," you know instantly something is wrong. No debate required.
- **No wasted scenes**: Every scene earns its place through causal connection, preventing filler accumulation.
- **Built-in conflict engine**: "But" automatically generates obstacles; "therefore" automatically generates consequences. Less time inventing complications.
- **Single A-story focus**: Since "Scott Tenorman Must Die," they abandoned multi-plot structures. One tight causal chain is easier to execute under deadline pressure.

The technique is literally **visual** in their process. Parker walks around with markers, writing the beats on a whiteboard divided into three acts. Between each beat, they write "therefore" or "but." Any "and then" is immediately visible as a problem requiring revision.

## Part 3: Their broader writing philosophy

### The writers' room culture

Beyond the but/therefore rule, Parker and Stone have articulated complementary principles that shape their storytelling:

**On simplicity:**
- Stone: "Just do one thing really right"
- Parker: "All you need is clarity"
- They discovered that a single well-constructed A-story outperforms episodes juggling multiple plots

**On collaboration:**
> "In our writers room, you never say 'no.' You almost never go, 'No, that won't work because of this.' You don't need that energy."

This positive-framing approach allows rapid idea generation. The but/therefore test provides the structural discipline—ideas can flow freely because they have a reliable filter.

**On anxiety and craft:**
> "Having that blank page in front of us is still the most terrifying thing in the world." —Parker

> "It's so cool to talk to you guys and pretend like we know what we're doing." —Stone

Even after decades, they describe the process as difficult. The technique isn't a magic solution—it's a tool for making the difficult slightly more manageable.

### What "6 Days to Air" reveals about the method

The documentary shows their complete workflow: ideas can strike instantly or take days to emerge. The early part of the week involves throwing around jokes about current events and pop culture. Bill Hader (who worked in their writers' room) described it as "having the dream job of just laughing hysterically." But beneath this apparent chaos, the but/therefore structure provides rigor.

Crucially, Parker describes editing as the moment when the rule becomes most important: "just becomes brutal because you have to go back in tomorrow and you've got to start taking scenes that are there and figuring out, 'Okay, how can we make this same thing happen in half the time and rewrite it.'" The technique enables both generation and ruthless cutting.

## Part 4: Theoretical connections to narrative tradition

### Aristotle: The original condemnation of "and then"

The Parker/Stone technique is a modern reformulation of principles Aristotle established in the *Poetics* (c. 335 BCE). His distinction between **propter hoc** (causal relationship) and **post hoc** (mere succession) maps directly onto the but/therefore framework:

> "It makes all the difference whether any given event is a case of propter hoc [causal relationship] or post hoc [mere succession]." —Poetics X.3

Aristotle explicitly condemned episodic plots:

> "Of all plots and actions the episodic are the worst. I call a plot 'episodic' in which the episodes or acts succeed one another without probable or necessary sequence."

For Aristotle, a unified plot should be "such that, if any one of them is displaced or removed, the whole will be disjointed and disturbed." A scene whose "presence or absence makes no visible difference, is not an organic part of the whole."

**The mapping is precise:**
- Parker/Stone's "and then" = Aristotle's **post hoc** (episodic)
- Parker/Stone's "but/therefore" = Aristotle's **propter hoc** (causal/unified)

### E.M. Forster's famous formulation

In *Aspects of the Novel* (1927), Forster provided the most-cited modern articulation:

> "'The king died, and then the queen died' is a story. 'The king died, and then the queen died of grief' is a plot. The time-sequence is preserved, but the sense of causality overshadows it."

Forster's "of grief"—the causation—is precisely what Parker/Stone mean by "therefore." His cognitive test anticipates their diagnostic:

> "Consider the death of the queen. If it is in a story we say 'and then?' If it is in a plot we ask 'why?' That is the fundamental difference."

### McKee, Snyder, and the screenwriting tradition

**Robert McKee** (*Story*, 1997) built his screenwriting framework around progressive complications and causal gaps. Each action by the protagonist "arouses forces of antagonism" creating a "Gap between expectation and result." McKee emphasizes that "clear and obvious causality is needed during the progressive complications or the audience will struggle to understand what is happening."

**Blake Snyder's** Save the Cat beat sheet implicitly relies on causal connection. Each beat represents a value change that **causes** the next movement: Catalyst → Debate → Break Into Two → B-Story → Midpoint → Bad Guys Close In, and so on. These aren't arbitrary checkpoints but causal turning points.

**John Truby** (*The Anatomy of Story*) makes it explicit: "The pathway of cause and effect becomes the spine of your story. If the story doesn't have a spine or has too many spines, it falls apart."

### Pixar's "Story Spine" parallel

The animation industry has its own version. Pixar uses Kenn Adams' Story Spine, which employs identical causality logic:

1. Once upon a time there was ___
2. Every day ___
3. Until one day ___
4. **Because of that** ___
5. **Because of that** ___
6. **Because of that** ___
7. Until finally ___
8. And ever since then ___

Emma Coats included this as Rule #4 in her viral "22 Rules of Storytelling." The repeated "because of that" is functionally equivalent to "therefore."

## Part 5: What "and then" structure looks like

### Why "and then" fails to create engagement

When scenes connect through "and then," several problems emerge:

**No momentum**: Without causation, each scene must generate interest independently. There's no cumulative energy building toward anything.

**No stakes**: If Scene A doesn't cause Scene B, then the outcome of Scene A doesn't matter. The audience subconsciously disengages.

**Reorderability**: The "shuffle test"—if you could rearrange scenes without breaking the story, you have episodic structure. True causal chains have a necessary sequence.

**Passive protagonists**: "And then" often signals that events happen **to** the character rather than **because of** the character's choices.

### Examples of episodic failure

Critics have identified specific works that suffer from "and then" structure:

- **Gigli** (2003): Cited as "nothing but 'and thens'"—a parade of disconnected scenes
- **The Mandalorian** (seasons 1-2): Despite a compelling overarching plot, some standalone episodes were criticized as filler precisely because they didn't causally connect to the main arc
- **Some slice-of-life novels**: A critic described one as "here we stopped at these guys' place and we hung out with them for a while and talked, and then we went to this place and did some stuff"

### The "false alarm" problem

K.M. Weiland identifies a specific pattern: storylines that build suspense but resolve without impact. A cancer scare subplot, for instance, that ends with "false alarm, everything's fine" and never affects subsequent story is pure "and then." Events happened, but they didn't **cause** anything.

The test: "After an 'episode,' things should not return to the status quo or it's an excisable tangent."

### Events IN a story vs. events that ARE the story

Film Crit Hulk's formulation: scenes need **meaning**, not just **occurrence**. The questions to ask of each scene:

1. What did the character learn by going into this scene?
2. Did they gain new insight into their problem?
3. How did this scene push the character further on their journey?
4. Does the outcome push toward the next scene goal?

If a scene doesn't change anything that persists, it's IN the story but not OF the story.

## Part 6: Codification as a reusable protocol

### The three-word diagnostic

| Word | Function | Strength |
|------|----------|----------|
| **AND** | Simple continuation | WEAK (episodic) |
| **BUT** | Introduces conflict/obstacle | STRONG (complication) |
| **THEREFORE** | Shows consequence/progress | STRONG (causation) |

### The practical testing protocol

**Step 1: List your beats**
Map your story on index cards, a whiteboard, or a digital tool. One beat per card. Don't worry about whether they're good yet—just get the sequence down.

**Step 2: Insert connectors**
Between each beat, literally write "and then," "but," or "therefore." Be honest. Which word actually fits?

**Step 3: Flag "and thens"**
Any beat connected by "and then" is suspect. Circle it. These are your problem areas.

**Step 4: Revise flagged beats**
For each flagged connection, ask:
- What **OBSTACLE** (but) could complicate this transition?
- What **CONSEQUENCE** (therefore) could this beat cause?
- How can I make the character's choice in Beat A directly produce Beat B?

**Step 5: Verify character agency**
Is the protagonist making choices that drive each transition? Or are things just happening to them? Causal chains work best when character decisions produce the consequences.

**Step 6: Check status quo**
Does each beat change something that persists? If the world is identical before and after a beat, you likely have "and then."

### Before/after revision examples

**Before (and then):**
"James goes out for a run, and then it rains, and then he goes swimming, and his ex-girlfriend is there, and then he goes home."

**After (but/therefore):**
"James goes out for a run, **BUT** it starts raining; **THEREFORE**, he goes swimming instead. **BUT** his ex-girlfriend is at the pool, **THEREFORE** he hurries home to avoid an awkward conversation."

**Before:**
"Jimmy went to the mall, and then he realized he was tired, and then he got a coffee, and then he walked back to the parking lot, and then he drove home."

**After:**
"Jimmy went to the mall, **BUT** realized he was exhausted the moment he stepped inside. **THEREFORE**, he picked up a coffee before shopping. **BUT** since he was tired, he'd parked in an illegal spot to shorten his walk. **THEREFORE**, by the time he returned, his car had been towed."

The second version has conflict, consequence, and escalation. Same basic events—completely different energy.

### Red flags for "and then" writing

- Character reacts to external events without making choices
- Events could be reordered without breaking the story (the shuffle test)
- Subplots that never intersect with the main plot
- "False alarm" resolutions that reset the status quo
- Information dumps disconnected from character goals
- Scenes that exist only to establish setting or "world-building"

### The revision questions

When stuck on a flagged beat, ask:

1. Why does Scene B happen **BECAUSE** of Scene A?
2. What **PREVENTS** the character from achieving their goal easily?
3. How has the **CHARACTER** changed because of this scene?
4. What **NEW PROBLEM** or complication emerges from the resolution?
5. If I removed this scene, would anything downstream break?

## The technique's spread beyond South Park

The but/therefore framework has been adopted across multiple fields:

**Brandon Sanderson** (fantasy novelist): "I hunt for the word 'and' when I rewrite, especially at big moments of my story. Then I figure out how to make it the word 'but' instead."

**Randy Olson** (marine biologist): Adapted the concept into the ABT Framework for scientific communication, teaching researchers to structure even grant proposals around And-But-Therefore.

**Film Crit Hulk** (screenwriter/critic): Dedicates significant attention to "The Law of Cause and Effect" in *Screenwriting 101*, calling it "the linking of your chain."

**David Perell** (writer/educator): Popularized the whiteboard testing method through his newsletter, reaching tens of thousands of writers.

## Conclusion: What this technique actually does

Parker and Stone's contribution is **pedagogical simplicity**, not theoretical novelty. They translated **2,400 years** of narrative theory—from Aristotle's condemnation of episodic plots through Forster's causation distinction through McKee's progressive complications—into a three-word test any writer can apply while staring at a whiteboard at 3 AM.

The technique works because it externalizes an internal cognitive process. Audiences naturally ask "why?" and "what happens next?" But/therefore structure ensures every scene answers both questions. "And then" structure forces audiences to supply their own causation—and when they can't, they check out.

But perhaps the deepest insight is how Parker framed it: as a **revision tool**, not just a planning tool. You don't need to nail the causal chain on the first pass. You write your beats, then you test them, then you hunt for the "ands" and figure out how to make them "buts" or "therefores." The technique assumes imperfection. It provides a systematic method for finding and fixing the weak links.

That's why a show written in six days can have tighter structure than films developed over years. Not because Parker and Stone are geniuses who get it right the first time—but because they have an efficient diagnostic for identifying exactly what's wrong and a clear directive for how to fix it.
