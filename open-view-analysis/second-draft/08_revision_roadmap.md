# OPEN VIEW — Revision Roadmap

**Draft:** Second Draft (2019-10-21)
**Analyst:** Claude (P7-COMPREHENSIVE Protocol)
**Date:** 2026-01-25
**Target:** Third Draft

---

## I. Revision Overview

### Current Status

OPEN VIEW is a formally ambitious script with a structurally sound core (Movements II, IV, V) wrapped in sprawling parallel material (Movements I, III, VI). The primary revision task is compression and causal binding; the secondary task is character voice and relationship development.

### Revision Philosophy

These recommendations preserve the script's formal ambitions (delayed inciting incident, cyclical ending, art cinema register) while strengthening execution. The goal is not to make OPEN VIEW more commercial but to make its challenging choices land more effectively.

### Revision Priority Matrix

| Priority | Category | Effort | Impact |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| **1** | Movement III Compression | High | High |
| **2** | Game Causal Trigger | Medium | High |
| **3** | Son's Motivation Clarification | Medium | High |
| **4** | Mom/Sis Relationship Development | Medium | High |
| **5** | Dad's Trauma Plant | Low | Medium |
| **6** | Voice Distinction (Son/Leader) | Low | Medium |
| **7** | Voice Distinction (Mom/Auntie) | Low | Low |
| **8** | Explicit Content Distribution | Low | Low |

## II. Critical Revisions (Structural)

### Revision R1: Movement III Compression

**Issue:** Movement III (Lines 1110-1867, ~20% of script) sprawls across three parallel storylines with weak causal binding.

**Target:** Reduce to ~12-15% (~450-550 lines, cutting ~200-300 lines)

**Specific Actions:**

#### R1.1: Cut Beat 33 (Camp Fantasy)

- **Location:** Lines 1489-1537 (~48 lines)
- **Rationale:** No causal function; tonally disruptive; AND THEN connection
- **Action:** Delete entirely

#### R1.2: Condense Sis's Audition Circuit

- **Current:** 5 beats (30-34), ~245 lines
- **Target:** 2 beats, ~100 lines
- **Action:**
  - Keep beat 30 (leaked photos interview) — establishes exploitation
  - Combine beats 31-34 into single audition sequence showing typecast rejection
  - Cut beat 33 (fantasy) entirely
  - Reduce beat 34 to single page: one audition, one rejection, out

#### R1.3: Condense Dad's Business Trip

- **Current:** 5 beats (25-29), ~219 lines
- **Target:** 3 beats, ~140 lines
- **Action:**
  - Keep beat 25 (airport reunion with Love) — brief
  - Combine beats 26-27 (hotel impotence + pool fantasy) into single sequence
  - Keep beat 28 (assault) — climax of subplot
  - Cut beat 12 (spa impotence) from Movement I as redundant
  - Keep beat 29 (return home) — transition

#### R1.4: Tighten Son/Leader Conspiracy

- **Current:** 5 beats (35-39), ~282 lines
- **Target:** 4 beats, ~220 lines
- **Action:**
  - Keep beat 35 (morning intimacy) — establishes relationship
  - Keep beat 36 (leadership reclamation) — power dynamic
  - Keep beat 37 (explosives) — plot plant — but CLARIFY MOTIVATION (see R2)
  - Combine beats 38-39 (jealousy + fight) into single scene
  - Cut repetitive jealousy dialogue

**Estimated Line Reduction:** ~250 lines

---

### Revision R2: Game Causal Trigger

**Issue:** The death-game activates without apparent cause. No character action triggers it; no external logic is provided.

**Current State:** HOME simply announces rules at line 2281.

**Target:** Plant causal connection between character action and game activation.

**Options (choose one):**

#### Option A: Son's Conspiracy Triggered the Game (Recommended)

- **Concept:** Son and Leader's conspiracy was an attempt to disrupt or destroy "the show." The game is the show's defensive response.
- **Implementation:**
  - In beat 37, have Son say: "They've been watching us our whole lives. This is how we make them stop."
  - In beat 39 (fight), have Leader say: "They know. They've known since we started."
  - In game announcement, have HOME say: "Unauthorized interference detected. Protocol activated."
- **Thematic Benefit:** Connects Son's arc to game; makes his death meaningful (he tried to fight back)
- **Effort:** Low (3-4 line additions/changes)

#### Option B: Mom's Lawyer Consultation Triggered Surveillance Escalation

- **Concept:** Mom's attempt to give away the baby flagged the family for "entertainment potential."
- **Implementation:**
  - Add line in lawyer scene: "These conversations are recorded for quality assurance."
  - In game announcement, subtle reference to "family instability index"
- **Thematic Benefit:** Connects surveillance theme more directly
- **Effort:** Low (2-3 line additions)

#### Option C: Dad's Affair Violence Was Being Filmed

- **Concept:** Dad's assault on "Mom Clone" and Love was captured; crossing violence threshold activated the game.
- **Implementation:**
  - Brief shot of camera in hotel hallway
  - Game announcement references "escalation threshold exceeded"
- **Thematic Benefit:** Connects Dad's violence to family's fate
- **Effort:** Low (1-2 visual additions)

**Recommendation:** Option A provides the strongest causal binding and gives Son's arc purpose. It also creates dramatic irony: Son's attempt to escape the system caused the system to destroy his family.

---

### Revision R3: Son's Motivation Clarification

**Issue:** Son and Leader handle explosives and discuss "wiping out a planet," but their plan is never specified.

**Current State:** Conspiracy exists but motivation is opaque.

**Target:** Clarify what Son thinks he's doing and why.

**Implementation:**

#### R3.1: Explicit Goal Statement (Beat 37)

Current dialogue is vague. Add:

```
SON: "They built this house. They built all the houses. They
     watch everything. I'm going to show them what happens when
     the experiment goes wrong."

LEADER: "You think blowing a hole in the wall changes anything?"

SON: "It changes everything. Or nothing. Either way, they stop
     watching this."
```

#### R3.2: Connect to Military Training (Beat 6)

In Son's introduction, plant seed:

```
SON (V.O.): "They said sacrifice is glory. They didn't say
            whose sacrifice, or whose glory."
```

#### R3.3: Death as Intentional (Beat 52)

When Mom finds Son, make his suicidal ideation connect to plan failure:

```
SON: "They knew. The second I brought the materials in, they
     knew. This was always how it was going to end."
```

**Effort:** Medium (15-20 lines total)

**Impact:** Transforms Son from passive victim to failed revolutionary; his death gains meaning; explosives become both Chekhov's gun and tragic irony.

---

## III. Important Revisions (Character/Theme)

### Revision R4: Mom/Sis Relationship Development

**Issue:** The emotional climax (Mom's sacrifice for Sis) depends on relationship not established in earlier movements.

**Current State:** Mom and Sis share minimal screen time before game; interactions are distant.

**Target:** Add one scene of authentic connection before the game.

**Implementation:**

#### R4.1: Beach Day Connection (Insert into Movement II, after beat 20)

New beat (~60 lines):

- Mom and Sis walk along water while Dad/Son play in background
- Sis confides: industry is crushing her; she doesn't know who she is outside performance
- Mom responds with vulnerability: she understands—she's been performing "mother" for years
- Brief genuine connection before retreating into familiar distance
- Seeds the final sacrifice: Mom knows what Sis is fighting for

**Placement:** Between beats 20 and 21 (Lines ~1000)

**Effect:** When Mom kills to save Sis, audience understands what she's saving—not just her daughter's life but her daughter's chance to be someone other than a performance.

---

### Revision R5: Dad's Trauma Plant

**Issue:** Dad's childhood sexual assault is revealed in Movement VI coda—too late to inform understanding of his earlier violence.

**Current State:** Revelation at lines 3521-3564 explains but doesn't land.

**Target:** Plant hint earlier so coda confirms what we suspect rather than introduces.

**Implementation:**

#### R5.1: Flashback Fragment During Hotel Assault (Beat 28)

During Dad's assault on "Mom Clone":

```
[FLASH: Children's laughter. Primary colors. Ball pit.]

DAD freezes mid-violence. Stares at his hands. Then strikes harder.
```

This 2-line visual insert plants the connection without explaining it. The coda's full reveal then completes what we glimpsed.

**Effort:** Low (2 lines + visual note)

---

### Revision R6: Sis Active Choice

**Issue:** Sis is consistently reactive; she makes no choice that affects outcome.

**Current State:** Things happen to Sis; she survives by circumstance and Mom's action.

**Target:** Give Sis one meaningful choice in Movement IV.

**Implementation:**

#### R6.1: Sis Chooses to Protect Someone

During the chaos (between beats 49-54), create moment:

- Sis sees Auntie cornered by Sidekick
- Sis could hide (safe) or intervene (dangerous)
- Sis chooses to intervene, drawing Sidekick's attention
- This buys time but puts Sis at risk
- Mom witnesses this—sees Sis's capacity for sacrifice

**Effect:** Sis demonstrates she can choose to protect others, not just survive. This makes Mom's sacrifice feel like recognition of Sis's worthiness, not just maternal compulsion.

**Effort:** Medium (~40 lines)

---

## IV. Polish Revisions (Craft)

### Revision P1: Voice Distinction (Son/Leader)

**Issue:** Son and Leader's dialogue is often indistinguishable.

**Implementation:**

- **Leader:** Commands; declarative sentences; authority markers ("We will," "You need to")
- **Son:** Questions; conditional sentences; subordinate markers ("Could we," "What if")

Pass through all Son/Leader scenes adjusting speech patterns.

**Effort:** Low (dialogue polish, no structural change)

---

### Revision P2: Voice Distinction (Mom/Auntie)

**Issue:** Sisters sound similar in phone conversations and restaurant scene.

**Implementation:**

- **Mom:** Formal, restrained, incomplete sentences (can't say what she means)
- **Auntie:** Performatively cheerful, run-on sentences, deflection through chatter

**Effort:** Low

---

### Revision P3: Uncle's Dance Fixation

**Issue:** Currently comic relief; underutilized.

**Implementation:**

Connect to performance theme in one line:

```
UNCLE: "We have very expensive tickets to the dance. The dance!
       Where people watch other people move. That's what we do.
       That's all we've ever done."
```

**Effort:** Low (1 line revision)

---

### Revision P4: Coda Pacing

**Issue:** Movement VI's parallel afterlives may feel long.

**Implementation:**

- Reduce each afterlife loop by ~20 lines
- Let pattern establish faster through quicker cuts
- Target: ~470 lines (from ~571), saving ~100 lines

**Effort:** Medium (requires trimming each loop proportionally)

---

## VI. Revision Metrics

### Target Third Draft

| Metric | Current | Target | Change |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| **Total Lines** | 3,777 | ~3,400 | -377 (~10%) |
| **Movement III** | 757 lines (20%) | ~500 lines (15%) | -257 lines |
| **Movement VI** | 571 lines (16%) | ~470 lines (14%) | -101 lines |
| **Added Material** | — | ~80 lines | +80 lines |
| **Causal Binding Score** | 78% | >82% | +4% |

### Success Criteria

| Criterion | Metric |
|-----------|--------|
| Movement III tighter | Reduced to <15% of script |
| Game activation causal | At least one character action triggers |
| Son motivation clear | Reader can articulate his plan |
| Mom/Sis connected | At least one authentic pre-game scene |
| Sis has agency | At least one meaningful choice |
| Voice distinction | Reader can identify speaker without tags |

## VII. Revision Risks

### Risk 1: Over-Compression Loses Atmosphere

**Concern:** Cutting too much from Movement III may lose the deliberate alienation effect.

**Mitigation:** Preserve at least one complete beat for each storyline; compress within beats rather than eliminating whole sequences.

### Risk 2: Causal Trigger Undermines Arbitrariness

**Concern:** Making the game causally triggered may undermine the thematic point that systemic violence is arbitrary.

**Mitigation:** Make the trigger disproportionate—Son's minor act causes massive response. The arbitrariness is in the disproportion, not the absence of cause.

### Risk 3: Added Character Moments Slow Pacing

**Concern:** Adding Mom/Sis scene and Sis choice moment adds length.

**Mitigation:** Net reduction still significant (~300 lines). Added material is emotionally essential; cuts are from structurally weak material.

### Risk 4: Art Cinema Audience May Prefer Current Form

**Concern:** Some revisions (clearer motivation, added relationships) move toward accessibility at expense of deliberate opacity.

**Mitigation:** Revisions preserve formal ambition (delayed inciting incident, cyclical ending). Clarity in character motivation ≠ resolution of thematic ambiguity.

---

## VIII. Post-Revision Assessment

After implementing Third Draft revisions, re-evaluate:

1. **Pacing:** Does Movement III now hold attention?
2. **Binding:** Does the game feel causally connected?
3. **Character:** Do we feel Mom/Sis relationship in the final exchange?
4. **Agency:** Does Sis feel like a participant, not just a survivor?
5. **Voice:** Can we identify speakers without tags?

If metrics improve and subjective reading confirms engagement, the Third Draft is ready for production development conversations.
