## II. Core Family Profiles

### LI (Mother, 40s)

**Role:** Primary Protagonist

**First Appearance:** Line 18 (arriving home in rain)
**Last Appearance:** Line 2810 (revealed as collaborator)

**Scene Count:** ~45% of script
**Dialogue Volume:** ~25% of total dialogue

---

#### Arc Classification

- [x] **Revelational** — True nature gradually revealed
- [ ] **Transformational** — Character changes internally
- [ ] **Static/Flat** — Serves function without change

*Li's arc is revelational: she appears to be a victim of her marriage and circumstances, but her capacity for violence (stomping Def) and her collaboration with HQ reframe everything we thought we understood.*

#### Opening State

Li arrives home exhausted, fighting rain and wind. She's scanned at the door—subject of surveillance from her first frame. She announces divorce with practiced calm, suggesting this is not the first attempt.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Controlled exterior (rarely loses composure)
- Capable of extreme violence (Def scene)
- Secretive (affair, collaboration, feelings about Lef)
- Maternal ambivalence ("another bird taken care of" when Lef dies)

#### Want vs. Need

**WANT (Conscious Goal):**
Divorce Fre; escape the marriage; manage the family's dysfunction

**NEED (Unconscious Necessity):**
Unknown—the script doesn't develop Li's interiority enough to identify need

**Relationship:**
- [ ] Want and Need aligned
- [ ] Want and Need opposed
- [x] Want only (Need underdeveloped)

#### Key Scenes

| Scene | Line | Function |
|-------|------|----------|
| Arrival/Entry | 18-51 | Introduction; subject of surveillance |
| Divorce announcement | 220-231 | Inciting incident; takes control |
| Bathroom argument | 411-560 | Best scene; reveals marriage dynamic |
| McDonald's smile | 1016-1032 | Only genuine moment of peace |
| Affair with Def | 1437-1492 | Reveals secret life |
| Violence against Def | 1493-1527 | MAJOR REVELATION: capacity for extreme violence |
| During Lef's death | 2263-2340 | "It's too late" / "another bird" |
| Collaborator reveal | 2804-2810 | FINAL TWIST (underdeveloped) |

#### Diagnostic Assessment

| Question | Answer | Note |
|----------|--------|------|
| Clear want? | Yes | Divorce; escape |
| Clear need? | No | Never identified |
| Meaningful choices? | Partial | Violence is choice; collaboration unclear |
| Choices have consequences? | Unclear | Script ends before consequences |
| Character changes or reveals? | Reveals | Violence; collaboration |
| Necessary to narrative? | Yes | Primary protagonist |
| Distinct voice? | Partial | Controlled; sometimes flat |

**Character Health Score:** ●●●○○ (Competent but incomplete)

---

### FRE (Father, late 40s)

**Role:** Secondary Protagonist / Major Supporting

**First Appearance:** Line 54 (bathroom, masturbating)
**Last Appearance:** Line 2793 (drugged after agreeing to kill Li)

**Scene Count:** ~30% of script
**Dialogue Volume:** ~22% of total dialogue

---

#### Arc Classification

- [ ] **Revelational**
- [x] **Transformational** — Descends from detachment to desperation
- [ ] **Static/Flat**

*Fre's arc is a descent: he begins emotionally detached (accepts divorce flatly) and becomes increasingly desperate (begs Nol to run away, is manipulated into agreeing to kill Li).*

#### Opening State

Fre sits on the toilet, masturbating to porn on his phone. He's established immediately as solipsistic, compulsive, and unfaithful. He accepts the divorce announcement with practiced indifference: "Where do I sign?"

**Key Characteristics:**
- Emotionally absent ("You wanted him. You get to have him.")
- Sexually compulsive (porn, affair, degradation kink with Nol)
- Self-pitying ("When do I get to go on vacation?")
- Pathetic rather than villainous

#### Want vs. Need

**WANT:** Escape—from marriage, responsibility, his own inadequacy
**NEED:** Connection; to be valued

**Resolution:** Need rejected—Nol rejects him; family doesn't value him; he's drugged and manipulated

#### Key Scenes

| Scene | Line | Function |
|-------|------|----------|
| Bathroom/porn | 54-79 | Introduction; sexuality as isolation |
| Divorce reaction | 232-262 | Emotional deadness |
| Bathroom argument | 411-560 | Best scene; contempt + shared history |
| Affair with Nol | 1057-1117 | Degradation dynamic |
| Nol rejects him | 1544-1620 | "Strike three"; pathetic |
| Trying to save Lef | 2263-2323 | Denial; "He's not dead yet" |
| Drugged/manipulated | 2784-2793 | Agrees to kill Li (underdeveloped) |

#### Diagnostic Assessment

**Character Health Score:** ●●●○○ (Competent but underexplored in Act III)

*Fre's manipulation into agreeing to kill Li is described in narrative notes rather than dramatized. His final state is unclear.*

---

### SUS (Daughter, 17)

**Role:** Major Supporting / Potential Final Girl

**First Appearance:** Line 81 (practicing pirouettes)
**Last Appearance:** Line 2782 ("Revenge"; Mis Sar not really there?)

**Scene Count:** ~25% of script
**Dialogue Volume:** ~12% of total dialogue

---

#### Arc Classification

- [x] **Revelational** — Abuse situation gradually revealed
- [ ] **Transformational**
- [ ] **Static/Flat**

*Sus's arc reveals her situation: she's being sexually abused by her ballet instructor, and her perfectionism/depression stem from this trauma. The "test" offers revenge but its outcome is unclear.*

#### Opening State

Sus practices pirouettes obsessively, counting aloud, faltering twice before reaching 15. Brief celebration immediately suppressed. She undresses—CENSORED—and the frames loop. Later, she stares into her laptop camera, motionless, tears welling, fighting to maintain control.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Perfectionist (counts pirouettes obsessively)
- Depressed (morning ritual of suppression)
- Abuse victim (Mis Sar's "stretching")
- Isolated from family and peers

#### Want vs. Need

**WANT:** Perfection; to be a star ("You will be a star")
**NEED:** Safety; escape from abuse; authentic connection

**Resolution:** Unclear—she takes the "revenge" test but Mis Sar "isn't really there"

#### Key Scenes

| Scene | Line | Function |
|-------|------|----------|
| Pirouettes | 81-108 | Introduction; discipline + suppression |
| Morning tears | 364-383 | Depression revealed |
| "Stretch" with Mis Sar | 1172-1248 | Sexual abuse depicted |
| Metro confrontation | 1675-1730 | "Kill Caesar"; peers know about abuse |
| Walking home | 1918-1926 | Only moment of peace in script |
| Test: Mis Sar in shower | 2684-2782 | Revenge offered; reality questioned |

#### Diagnostic Assessment

**Character Health Score:** ●●○○○ (Needs work)

*The abuse subplot is introduced with disturbing specificity then abandoned. Sus's "test" outcome is left deliberately ambiguous but feels incomplete rather than mysterious.*

---

### ROK (Son, 16)

**Role:** Major Supporting / Test Subject

**First Appearance:** Line 110 (exercising, then vomiting)
**Last Appearance:** Line 2777 (drowns with Gre)

**Scene Count:** ~25% of script
**Dialogue Volume:** ~14% of total dialogue

---

#### Arc Classification

- [x] **Revelational** — Sexuality gradually revealed
- [x] **Tragic** — Desires lead to death

*Rok's arc reveals his suppressed sexuality: he's attracted to Gre (his wrestling teammate) while performing heterosexuality with Em. His "test" offers Gre, but choosing desire means death.*

#### Opening State

Rok exercises shirtless, phone positioned to record himself. He suddenly retches, runs off-screen, vomits three times. Returns to position. Loop. He's established as body-obsessed, bulimic, and performing for an audience (even when alone).

**Key Characteristics:**
- Bulimic ("feeling a puke coming on")
- Closeted or confused about sexuality
- Cruel to those available (Em)
- Longing for those unavailable (Gre)

#### Want vs. Need

**WANT:** Gre; connection with his true desire
**NEED:** Self-acceptance; escape from self-punishment

**Resolution:** Want achieved = death. He pushes the button, embraces Gre, drowns.

#### Key Scenes

| Scene | Line | Function |
|-------|------|----------|
| Exercise/vomit | 110-139 | Introduction; body discipline |
| Wrestling with Gre | 1250-1285 | Desire established; lingering embrace |
| Gre in locker room | 1336-1370 | Unrequited; "I don't play games" |
| Rejecting Em | 1763-1854 | Cruelty; "You made me be mean" |
| Foot trapped | 2164-2201 | Physical harm; vulnerability |
| Test: Gre in shower | 2658-2777 | Pushes button immediately; drowns with Gre |

#### Diagnostic Assessment

**Character Health Score:** ●●●○○ (Competent)

*Rok's arc is the most complete in the script. His desire for Gre is established, tested, and resolved (tragically). However, the drowning sequence is brief—more development would deepen impact.*

---

### LEF (Unborn child)

**Role:** Symbolic / Victim

**First Appearance:** Line 857 (in grow tank)
**Last Appearance:** Line 2371 (heart rate nil; dies)

---

#### Function

Lef is not a character but a symbol: the family's potential future, gestating in a technological womb, dreaming of a life that will never happen. His death is the script's central horror image—a child boiled alive while his family watches and argues about whose fault it is.

**Dreams Shown:**
- Cuddling with parents
- Shaving with dad
- Playing piano to applause
- Hand on stove (nightmare)
- Falling into darkness (nightmare)

*The dreams represent both aspiration (family connection, achievement) and premonition (violence, death).*

---

## III. HQ Characters

### WOT (Elder, the Boss)

**Role:** Antagonist (HQ)
**Lines:** ~60 (scattered)

The leader of the surveillance operation. Wears her age "unlike others"—suggesting anti-aging is optional for her. Tests Jra on "Series A vs Series B" selection criteria.

**Key Lines:**
- "Was Series B the right one?"
- "We didn't see her coming at all"
- "I guess we will see. You doubt a male's sex drive."

**Assessment:** Abstract antagonist. Motivation never explained. Why this family? Why this game?

---

### JRA (Younger Successor)

**Role:** Internal Opposition (HQ)
**Lines:** ~50

Wot's designated successor who doubts the mission. Unmasks herself in what appears to be an act of rebellion.

**Key Lines:**
- "It's not what I would've chosen necessarily"
- "This has been one huge mistake"
- "The woman live. The woman live for now on."

**Assessment:** Set up for rebellion that doesn't materialize in current draft.

---

### LON (Operative)

**Role:** Potential Saboteur (HQ)
**Lines:** ~20

Introduced as "she's here to burn it down." Watches HQ feeds, gathering intelligence. At the end, "switches feeds and tricks Wot. Reveals whole company."

**Assessment:** Rebellion barely dramatized. Her actions at line 2794-2799 are narrative notes, not scenes.

---

## IV. Affair Partners

### NOL (Fre's Mistress)

**Role:** Minor Supporting
**Lines:** ~80

Enters spitting on floor; "You're a pig." Engages in degradation play with Fre. Eventually rejects him ("Strike three").

**Key Lines:**
- "Who doesn't hate their husband?"
- "Nothing will mean anything one day"
- "Your cloud is going to follow you wherever you go"

**Function:** Mirror for Fre's pathology; delivers existential verdict

---

### DEF (Li's Affair Partner)

**Role:** Minor Supporting / Victim
**Lines:** ~30

Middle-aged client. Affair involves mutual degradation ("We're disgusting"). Victim of Li's extreme violence—she stomps his face with her boot heel.

**Key Line:**
- "For three minutes, maybe once or twice" (re: loving his wife)

**Function:** Reveals Li's capacity for violence

---

## V. Youth Characters

### GRE (Rok's Teammate)

**Role:** Object of Desire / Victim
**Lines:** ~20

Rok's wrestling teammate. Their embrace after the match lingers a second too long. Gre is cold to Rok's overtures ("I don't play games"). Appears hogtied in shower; drowns with Rok.

**Function:** Embodies Rok's forbidden desire; dies fulfilling it

---

### EM (Rok's Girlfriend)

**Role:** Minor Supporting
**Lines:** ~40

Enthusiastic girlfriend Rok doesn't want. Subject to his cruelty: "I'm not trying to have kids tomorrow. Especially not with you."

**Function:** Represents the heterosexual performance Rok can't sustain

---

### MIS SAR (Ballet Instructor)

**Role:** Abuser
**Lines:** ~20

Older woman "glowing with forced youth." Calls Sus to her office for "stretching." Grips her thighs with "tight claws." Appears naked in Sus's shower during the "test."

**Key Line:**
- "You will be a star"

**Function:** Represents institutional predation; power disguised as mentorship
