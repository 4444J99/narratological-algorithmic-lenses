STUDY PROMPT: PIXAR'S NARRATOLOGICAL ALGORITHMS

Objective: Distill Pixar's articulated storytelling methodology into formal principles for emotionally-precise, dual-audience, and structurally-rigorous narrative construction.

Primary Sources:
- Pixar in a Box (Khan Academy seriesâ€”storytelling modules)
- Andrew Stanton TED Talk "The Clues to a Great Story"
- "Creativity, Inc." (Ed Catmull)â€”studio methodology
- Director commentaries (especially Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Up, Inside Out)
- "Pixar's 22 Rules of Storytelling" (Emma Coats/Pixar story artist)

Secondary Sources:
- "The Pixar Touch" (David Price)
- Academic work on Pixar narrative structure

EXTRACTION TARGETS:

1. SETUP/PAYOFF MECHANICS
   - The "plant and payoff" obsession
   - Tracking setup density per act
   - Payoff timing and placement
   - The "Pixar ending" where setups converge

2. EMPATHY ENGINEERING
   - "What if X had feelings" as generator
   - How to make non-human protagonists relatable
   - The opening sequence as empathy-builder (Up case study)
   - Desire/need/wound integration

3. DUAL-AUDIENCE ADDRESS
   - Child-accessible surface, adult depth
   - Joke layering by comprehension level
   - Thematic complexity without narrative complexity
   - The "Pixar cry" trigger points

4. COMEDIC TIMING STRUCTURES
   - Rule of threes deployment
   - Visual comedy grammar
   - Comedic relief placement within dramatic structure
   - Physical comedy design in animation

5. "THE RULES" ANALYSIS
   - Formalize Emma Coats' 22 rules
   - Which are universal, which are Pixar-specific
   - Contradictions and tensions within the rules
   - Hierarchy of importance

AXIOM CANDIDATES (verify against Stanton, Catmull, Pixar in a Box):
- PX-A0: "Make me care"â€”empathy is non-negotiable (Stanton)
- PX-A1: Simplicity is the goal; complexity is the process (Catmull)
- PX-A2: Story is tested, not written (the "brain trust" model)
- PX-A3: Entertainment and meaning are not opposites

THEORETICAL CORRESPONDENCES TO MAP:
- McKee's scene/act structure (Pixar adherence)
- South Park's efficiency (compare setup/payoff density)
- Larry David's cascade logic (compare escalation)
- Aristotle's catharsis (Pixar emotional design)

| If Starting With | Consider Following With | Rationale |
|------------------|------------------------|-----------|
| Ovid | Gaiman (Sandman) | Anthology structure, myth-remix tradition |
| Tarkovsky | Bergman | Contrasting approaches to cinematic interiority |
| Bergman | Lynch | Psychology â†’ surreal psychology |
| Moore | Morrison | Formalism â†’ hypersigil (contrast/debate) |
| Kirby | Tolkien | Mythopoeic parallel across media |
| Zelda | Final Fantasy | Two approaches to interactive narrative |
| Tarantino | Ovid | Both masters of non-linear linking |
| Pixar | Final Fantasy | Emotional engineering, ensemble management |
| Ellis | Tarantino | Genre play, world-as-system |
