## Usage Notes

1. **Logline**: Must contain protagonist, goal, obstacle, stakes. One compound sentence maximum.

2. **Synopsis**: Should be readable as a standalone document. Someone unfamiliar with the script should understand the complete story.

3. **Assessment Matrix**: Be honest. A 3 is not an insult — it's a professional assessment that the work has potential but needs development.

4. **Recommendation**: Only one box checked. If uncertain between categories, default to the more conservative option.

5. **Strengths/Areas**: Balance is important. Even a PASS recommendation should acknowledge strengths; even a RECOMMEND should note areas for polish.

6. **Comparables**: Choose works that illuminate the script's positioning, not just surface similarities. One comparable should be a commercial reference, one an artistic reference.

7. **First-Reader Response**: This section should be raw and honest. It's the only place where subjective response trumps analytical observation.
