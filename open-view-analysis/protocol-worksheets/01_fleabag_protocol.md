# Fleabag Protocol Worksheet
## Intimacy Architecture & Direct Address Analysis

> Derived from Phoebe Waller-Bridge's methodology: weaponized vulnerability, confession as structure, fourth-wall as intimacy mechanism.

---

## 0. Meta-Principles (Axioms)

| Axiom | Formulation |
|-------|-------------|
| PWB-A0 | **The audience is a character.** Direct address creates a relationship that must develop, betray, and resolve like any other. |
| PWB-A1 | **Confession deflects.** Characters reveal truth to avoid deeper truth; the confession is armor, not surrender. |
| PWB-A2 | **Intimacy is structural.** The closer we get to the character, the more the fourth wall becomes load-bearing. |
| PWB-A3 | **Comedy is grief's bodyguard.** Humor exists to protect unbearable feeling; when the joke stops, pay attention. |
| PWB-A4 | **The audience knows before the character does.** Dramatic irony flows toward the screen, not away from it. |

## 1. Structural Hierarchy

```
SERIES
  └── EPISODE (self-contained emotional unit)
        └── SCENE (behavioral showcase)
              └── BEAT (micro-confession/deflection cycle)
                    └── GLANCE (fourth-wall punctuation)
```

### Definition Table

| Unit | Definition | Constraint |
|------|------------|------------|
| **Glance** | Momentary break to camera | Must signal shift: irony, plea, lie, or realization |
| **Beat** | Confession-deflection pair | Each confession enables avoidance of deeper confession |
| **Scene** | Behavioral showcase | Character performs for internal audience (other characters) while confessing to external audience (us) |
| **Episode** | Emotional unit | Must contain one moment where fourth wall becomes painful rather than comic |

## 2. Direct Address Analysis

### 2.1 Fourth-Wall Inventory

For each draft, catalog all instances of direct address (or potential direct address moments):

| Scene | Character | Type | Function | Emotional Register |
|-------|-----------|------|----------|-------------------|
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

**Address Types:**
- `IRONIC` — Character shares joke at situation's expense
- `CONFESSIONAL` — Character reveals hidden feeling
- `PERFORMATIVE` — Character performs for our approval
- `PLEADING` — Character seeks validation/forgiveness
- `CAUGHT` — Character realizes we've seen something they didn't mean to show
- `SILENT` — Meaningful look without words

### 2.2 Direct Address Density Test

```
DENSITY_CALCULATION:
  total_glances = COUNT(direct_address_moments)
  total_scenes = COUNT(scenes)

  density = total_glances / total_scenes

  FLEABAG_BENCHMARK: ~2-4 glances per scene average

  IF density < 1.0: Underutilized (audience relationship underdeveloped)
  IF density > 5.0: Overutilized (gimmick, not structure)
```

**Draft Score:** _____ glances / _____ scenes = _____ density

### 2.3 Evolution Test

Does the nature of direct address change across the draft?

| Act | Predominant Address Type | Audience Relationship Status |
|-----|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| Opening | | |
| Midpoint | | |
| Climax | | |
| Resolution | | |

**VALID if:** Address types evolve from IRONIC → CONFESSIONAL → CAUGHT/SILENT
**INVALID if:** Address types remain static throughout

## 3. Confession-Deflection Mechanics

### 3.1 Confession Hierarchy

Map what the character confesses vs. what they're avoiding:

```
SURFACE_CONFESSION (what they say)
       │
       │ deflects from
       ▼
MIDDLE_CONFESSION (what they almost admit)
       │
       │ deflects from
       ▼
CORE_WOUND (what they cannot say)
```

**Draft Analysis:**

| Character | Surface Confession | Middle Confession | Core Wound |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |

### 3.2 Deflection Inventory

How do characters avoid deeper truth?

| Deflection Type | Description | Instances in Draft |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Joke** | Humor interrupts vulnerability | |
| **Sex** | Physical intimacy replaces emotional | |
| **Cruelty** | Hurting others to avoid own pain | |
| **Performance** | Playing a role for audience | |
| **Literalism** | Answering surface, ignoring subtext | |
| **Exit** | Physical departure from scene | |

### 3.3 Confession Breakthrough Test

```
BREAKTHROUGH_VALIDITY:
  REQUIRES: At least ONE moment where:
    - Deflection mechanism fails
    - Character says what they actually mean
    - Fourth wall cannot protect them

  CLIMAX_TEST:
    Does the protagonist confess CORE_WOUND (to us or to another character)?

    IF yes: Catharsis possible
    IF no: Emotional arc incomplete
```

**Draft Status:**
- [ ] Breakthrough moment present
- [ ] Core wound articulated
- [ ] Fourth wall becomes burden rather than shield

## 4. Intimacy Architecture

### 4.1 Who Knows What Grid

Track information asymmetry between audience and characters:

| Information | Audience Knows | Protagonist Knows | Other Characters Know |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

**FLEABAG PRINCIPLE:** Audience should know more than other characters but sometimes less than protagonist (and protagonist sometimes knows less than we do about themselves).

### 4.2 Complicity Test

At what point does the audience become complicit in the protagonist's behavior?

```
COMPLICITY_MECHANISM:
  1. We are charmed (SEDUCTION)
  2. We are shown bad behavior (REVELATION)
  3. We are implicated by our enjoyment (COMPLICITY)
  4. We are forced to reckon (RECKONING)

  INCOMPLETE if any stage missing.
```

**Draft Stages Present:**
- [ ] Seduction
- [ ] Revelation
- [ ] Complicity
- [ ] Reckoning

### 4.3 The Caught Moment

Is there a moment where the protagonist is "caught" by the camera doing something they'd prefer we didn't see?

| Moment | What We See | What It Reveals |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| | | |

**FLEABAG PRINCIPLE:** The caught moment is more intimate than any confession.

## 5. Comedy-Grief Calibration

### 5.1 Joke Density Map

Chart joke frequency against emotional intensity:

```
SCENE EMOTIONAL INTENSITY
High  |     * *        *
      |   *     *    *  *
      | *         **      *
Low   |________________________
        Many  ←JOKES→  Few
```

**FLEABAG PATTERN:** Inverse relationship — highest joke density in scenes with highest emotional stakes, until the pattern breaks at climax.

### 5.2 Humor Withdrawal Test

```
HUMOR_WITHDRAWAL:
  Identify the moment where humor STOPS protecting the character.

  MARKER: Scene where audience expects joke but gets silence/pain instead.

  PLACEMENT: Should occur in final act, not before.

  IF present: Emotional payoff enabled
  IF absent: Comedic armor never penetrated
```

**Draft Status:**
- [ ] Humor withdrawal moment identified
- [ ] Placement appropriate (late in structure)
- [ ] Emotional payoff delivered

## 6. Diagnostic Questions

Answer YES/NO for structural validation:

**Direct Address**
1. Does the draft contain moments of direct address (or clear opportunities for them)? ____
2. Does the address relationship evolve over the draft's runtime? ____
3. Is there a moment where the fourth wall becomes painful rather than comic? ____

**Confession Architecture**
4. Can you identify a clear CORE_WOUND for the protagonist? ____
5. Do surface confessions deflect from deeper truths? ____
6. Is there a breakthrough moment where deflection fails? ____

**Intimacy Mechanics**
7. Does the audience know things other characters don't? ____
8. Is there a complicity arc (seduction → revelation → complicity → reckoning)? ____
9. Is there a "caught" moment of exposed vulnerability? ____

**Comedy-Grief Balance**
10. Does humor density correlate inversely with emotional stakes? ____
11. Is there a humor withdrawal moment in the final act? ____
12. When the joke stops, does something meaningful fill the silence? ____

**Scoring:**
- 10-12 YES: Strong Fleabag-protocol alignment
- 7-9 YES: Partial alignment; specific mechanisms underdeveloped
- 4-6 YES: Significant structural gaps
- 0-3 YES: Different protocol may be more appropriate

**Draft Score:** _____ / 12

## 7. Protocol-Specific Revision Prompts

Based on diagnostic results, address the following:

### If Direct Address Underdeveloped:
- Identify 3 moments where a character could break the fourth wall
- For each, determine: What would they confess? What would they be deflecting from?
- Consider: Who is the "audience" within the world? (Security cameras? Surveillance systems? Interview format?)

### If Confession Architecture Weak:
- Write the CORE_WOUND for your protagonist in one sentence
- Work backward: What middle confession deflects from it? What surface confession deflects from that?
- Ensure each scene contains at least one confession-deflection cycle

### If Intimacy Mechanics Missing:
- Create a "Who Knows What" grid for your draft
- Identify where audience knowledge exceeds character knowledge
- Design one "caught" moment of exposed vulnerability

### If Comedy-Grief Imbalanced:
- Map joke density against emotional intensity scene by scene
- Identify where humor protects characters from feeling
- Choose one moment to withdraw humor and let pain exist undeflected

---

## 8. Application Notes for *Open View*

**Surveillance as Fourth Wall:** The draft's existing surveillance infrastructure (cameras, smart home, monitoring) could function as the "audience" relationship. Characters aware of being watched = built-in direct address opportunity.

**Clone/Family as Deflection:** Family members as potential mirrors — confessing to one's double could literalize the Fleabag self-address mechanic.

**Smart Home as Intimacy Violator:** The house that responds to commands = audience that won't let you hide.

## Quick Reference Card

### Fourth-Wall Evolution
```
IRONIC → CONFESSIONAL → CAUGHT → SILENT
(early)                           (climax)
```

### Confession Stack
```
SURFACE_CONFESSION (said)
       ↓ deflects from
MIDDLE_CONFESSION (almost said)
       ↓ deflects from
CORE_WOUND (cannot say)
```

### Complicity Arc
```
SEDUCTION → REVELATION → COMPLICITY → RECKONING
```

### Key Tests
```
✓ Joke density inversely correlates with emotional stakes
✓ Humor withdraws at climax
✓ At least one "caught" moment exists
✗ Direct address remains static throughout
✗ Confession never reaches core wound
✗ Audience never becomes complicit
```
