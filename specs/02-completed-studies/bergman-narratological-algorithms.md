## I. META-PRINCIPLES (AXIOMS)

### Foundational Axiom
**IB-A0: "Film is dream, film is music."**
> The cinema operates through affective logic rather than rational argument. Like dreams, it bypasses linguistic mediation to access emotional truth directly. Like music, it structures time as felt duration rather than measured sequence.

This axiom establishes Bergman's fundamental departure from theatrical realism despite his deep roots in stage practice. Where theater requires verbal articulation, cinema permits direct transmission of psychological states through visual rhythm and composition.

### Core Operational Axioms

**IB-A1: The Face Contains All Drama**
> "The human face is the great subject of the cinema. Everything can be read in the face."

The close-up is not merely a technique but an ontological claim: the face is the primary site where interiority becomes visible. Unlike landscape or architecture, the face cannot dissemble completely---micro-expressions betray what words conceal.

**IB-A2: Intimacy Requires Constraint**
> Dramatic intensity varies inversely with spatial and numerical expansion. The fewer the characters and the more confined the space, the greater the potential for psychological excavation.

This axiom, derived from Strindberg's chamber play principles, generates the formal constraints that intensify rather than limit dramatic possibilities.

**IB-A3: Demons Must Be Named to Be Expelled**
> "One must make films about things one knows, about what hurts. The only way to get rid of one's demons is to portray them."

Art as exorcism: the therapeutic function of creative work operates through confrontation and articulation rather than avoidance. The naming of psychological forces transforms them from possessing agents into represented objects.

**IB-A4: Silence Is the Presence of Absence**
> God's silence is not neutral emptiness but active withdrawal. The unanswered prayer creates meaning through its very failure.

*Contrast with Tarkovsky:* Where AT-A6 posits silence as plenum (presence beyond speech), Bergman's silence is kenotic---an emptying that demands response. This reflects the Protestant dialectic of faith versus the Orthodox theology of divine presence.

**IB-A5: The Mask Reveals the Face**
> The persona (social mask) and the authentic self exist in productive tension. Stripping away pretense does not reveal a stable identity but another layer of performance, unto the void.

## IV. DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS

### Chamber Drama Assessment

1. **Is the space sufficiently constrained?**
   - Can characters easily leave? (They shouldn't be able to)
   - Does the architecture create psychological pressure?
   - Are there threshold spaces (doors, windows) that mark inside/outside?

2. **Is the cast minimally essential?**
   - Could any character be removed without destroying the drama?
   - Is there a clear dyadic core?
   - Does each additional character serve irreplaceable function?

3. **Is the temporal pressure adequate?**
   - Does the drama enter at crisis point?
   - Is there urgency beyond plot mechanics?
   - Does death (literal or metaphorical) hover?

### Facial Phenomenology Assessment

4. **Is the face being used as landscape?**
   - Are close-ups held long enough to reveal layers?
   - Is the lighting serving revelation or concealment?
   - Does the face show what words cannot say?

5. **Is the mask-face dialectic operative?**
   - Can we see the effort of performance?
   - Are there moments when the mask slips?
   - Is there a face beneath the face?

6. **Is silence functioning as presence?**
   - Does silence create meaning through absence?
   - Is the unanswered speech more powerful than answer?
   - Does silence shift power dynamics?

### Psychodrama Assessment

7. **Is the confession sequence structured for maximum exposure?**
   - Is there reluctance overcome?
   - Is there progressive revelation?
   - Is there an unspeakable core finally spoken?

8. **Are identity boundaries appropriately unstable?**
   - Do characters project onto each other?
   - Are there moments of fusion/confusion?
   - Is it unclear where one psyche ends and another begins?

9. **Is the existential confrontation genuine?**
   - Is God's silence addressed?
   - Is death's presence felt?
   - Is the question of meaning at stake?

## V. QUICK REFERENCE CARD

### The Bergman Method in Brief

```
SPACE:      Compress until escape is impossible
CAST:       Reduce until each presence is essential
TIME:       Enter at crisis, maintain pressure
FACE:       The primary text---read it obsessively
SILENCE:    Absence that creates presence
CONFESSION: The monologue as excavation
IDENTITY:   Masks beneath masks unto void
GOD:        The unanswered question
DEATH:      The uninvited guest always present
THEATER:    The form remembered, transformed
CINEMA:     The intimacy theater cannot achieve
```

## VI. THEORETICAL CORRESPONDENCE TABLE

### A. Bergman-Tarkovsky Mapping

| Dimension | Bergman | Tarkovsky | Relationship |
|-----------|---------|-----------|--------------|
| **Primary Visual Unit** | The Face | The Landscape | CONTRAST: Physiognomic vs. Environmental interiority |
| **Interiority Access** | Through facial surface | Through spatial traversal | CONTRAST: Direct vs. Mediated |
| **Silence Function** | Absence (kenotic) | Presence (plerotic) | OPPOSITION: Protestant vs. Orthodox theology |
| **Time Treatment** | Compressed crisis | Extended duration | CONTRAST: Theatrical vs. Contemplative |
| **Spiritual Mode** | Wrestling with doubt | Dwelling in mystery | CONTRAST: Dialectical vs. Apophatic |
| **Camera Movement** | Approach to face | Movement through space | CONTRAST: Centripetal vs. Centrifugal |
| **Element Emphasis** | Interior (rooms) | Elements (water, fire, earth) | CONTRAST: Architectural vs. Elemental |
| **Death Representation** | Personified (chess-player) | Atmospheric (zone, sacrifice) | CONTRAST: Dramatic vs. Ambient |
| **Redemption Model** | Uncertain/Earned | Grace/Given | CONTRAST: Protestant vs. Orthodox |
| **Dream Logic** | Nightmare/Trauma | Memory/Nostalgia | CONTRAST: Freudian vs. Bergsonian |

### B. Shared Concerns

Despite methodological opposition, Bergman and Tarkovsky share:

1. **Commitment to Interiority**: Both reject external action as primary meaning-carrier
2. **Spiritual Seriousness**: Both refuse to reduce existence to material terms
3. **Temporal Consciousness**: Both understand cinema as time-art fundamentally
4. **Artistic Integrity**: Both reject commercial compromise
5. **Autobiographical Investment**: Both use personal material as source
6. **Death Awareness**: Both make mortality central
7. **Maternal Presence**: Both return obsessively to mother-figures
8. **Artistic Self-Reflexivity**: Both make films about making meaning

### Protocol 3: Confession Sequence Construction

```
FUNCTION build_confession_sequence(narrative_context):

    # Prerequisites:
    relationship_established = TRUE
    trust_or_breakdown_conditions = MET
    listener_positioned = RECEPTIVE_OR_FORCED_TO_HEAR

    # Content development:
    confession_layers = structure_progressively([
        "What I did",
        "What I felt",
        "What I cannot admit",
        "Who I am beneath"
    ])

    # Technical approach:
    intercutting = SPEAKER_LISTENER_RHYTHM
    close_up_intensity = INCREASES_WITH_REVELATION
    duration = LONGER_THAN_COMFORTABLE

## VIII. SYNTHESIS: THE BERGMAN CONTRIBUTION

### The Essential Innovation

Bergman's contribution to narrative technique centers on the **systematic use of the face as a complete dramatic landscape**. Where Tarkovsky found interiority in environmental traversal, Bergman discovered that the human face, properly approached, contains infinite depth.

### The Chamber Drama as Form

The chamber drama form---derived from Strindberg but perfected for cinema---provides the constraint mechanism that generates intensity. By eliminating escape, reducing cast, and compressing time, Bergman creates pressure that forces psychological revelation.

### The Theatrical-Cinematic Synthesis

Bergman's theater background is not transcended but transformed. The verbal density, dramatic structure, and performative intensity of theater are retained while the intimacy of cinema---the whisper, the micro-expression, the held close-up---enables access impossible on stage.

### The Protestant Phenomenology of Absence

Bergman's treatment of silence, God, and meaning reflects a specifically Protestant sensibility: the absence that demands faith, the silence that is itself message, the unanswered prayer that creates the questioner. This stands in productive contrast to Tarkovsky's Orthodox plerotic silence.

### The Confession as Excavation

The extended confession sequence---one speaker, one silent listener, progressive revelation---represents a unique Bergman form. It combines theatrical monologue with cinematic intimacy to create moments of psychological excavation unprecedented in narrative art.

## IX. CONCLUSION: IMPLEMENTING BERGMAN PRINCIPLES

To apply Bergman's narratological algorithms:

1. **Constrain ruthlessly**: Space, cast, time, escape routes
2. **Trust the face**: It will tell what dialogue cannot
3. **Use silence actively**: Absence creates meaning
4. **Stage confessions structurally**: Progressive revelation, silent witness
5. **Accept ambiguity**: Endings need not resolve
6. **Make death present**: The uninvited guest sharpens meaning
7. **Question God**: Even through silence, especially through silence
8. **Honor the mask**: Its effort at concealment is itself revelation
9. **Synthesize forms**: Theater's intensity, cinema's intimacy
10. **Excavate personally**: The demons named are demons expelled

*"The human face is the great subject of the cinema. All those close-ups of objects that we are forced to sit through in modern films... The human face is the starting point of our work."*
