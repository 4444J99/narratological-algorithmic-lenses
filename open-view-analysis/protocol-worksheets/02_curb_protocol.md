# Curb Your Enthusiasm Protocol Worksheet
## Collision Comedy & Social Contract Analysis

> Derived from Larry David's methodology: multi-thread collision, social contract violation, embarrassment escalation, and the "pretty, pretty good" principle of causal binding.

---

## 0. Meta-Principles (Axioms)

| Axiom | Formulation |
|-------|-------------|
| LD-A0 | **No hugging, no learning.** Characters do not grow, change, or gain wisdom. They end where they began, having learned nothing. |
| LD-A1 | **Social contracts are invisible until violated.** Comedy emerges from exposing the unspoken rules everyone follows. |
| LD-A2 | **Every thread must collide.** Seemingly unrelated storylines converge; no setup exists without payoff. |
| LD-A3 | **The protagonist is always right and always wrong.** Technically correct behavior that is socially catastrophic. |
| LD-A4 | **Embarrassment is cumulative.** Each violation adds to the total; the climax is maximum accumulated shame. |

---

## 1. Structural Hierarchy

```
EPISODE
  └── STORYLINE_THREAD (2-4 per episode)
        └── SETUP (plant element early)
              └── ESCALATION (violation compounds)
                    └── COLLISION (threads converge)
                          └── CATASTROPHE (maximum embarrassment)
```

### Definition Table

| Unit | Definition | Constraint |
|------|------------|------------|
| **Thread** | Independent storyline with own logic | Must connect to at least one other thread by episode end |
| **Setup** | Introduction of element that will pay off | Must seem incidental when introduced |
| **Escalation** | Social violation compounds | Each step must be worse than the last |
| **Collision** | Threads intersect | All elements present simultaneously |
| **Catastrophe** | Maximum social damage | All violations exposed; no escape possible |

---

## 2. Thread Architecture Analysis

### 2.1 Thread Inventory

Identify all independent storylines in the draft:

| Thread ID | Thread Description | Setup Element | Expected Payoff |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| A | | | |
| B | | | |
| C | | | |
| D | | | |

**CURB BENCHMARK:** 2-4 distinct threads per episode-length unit (~30 pages)

### 2.2 Thread Collision Map

```
COLLISION_MAPPING:
  Thread A ──────┐
                 │
  Thread B ──────┼───→ COLLISION POINT ───→ CATASTROPHE
                 │
  Thread C ──────┘
```

Document how threads intersect:

| Collision | Threads Involved | Bridge Element | Result |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|--------|
| 1 | | | |
| 2 | | | |
| Final | | | |

### 2.3 Thread Independence Test

```
INDEPENDENCE_TEST:
  FOR each thread:
    IF thread removed:
      Does story still function? → If YES, thread is decoration, not structure
      Does collision still work? → If YES, thread is unnecessary

  VALID thread: Removal damages collision point
  INVALID thread: Can be excised without structural loss
```

**Draft Assessment:**

| Thread | Necessary for Collision? | Status |
|--------|-------------------------|--------|
| A | YES / NO | VALID / INVALID |
| B | YES / NO | VALID / INVALID |
| C | YES / NO | VALID / INVALID |

---

## 3. Setup/Payoff Mechanics

### 3.1 Setup Inventory

Catalog all planted elements:

| Setup | Location (Page/Scene) | Visibility Level | Eventual Payoff |
|-------|----------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| | | LOW / MED / HIGH | |
| | | LOW / MED / HIGH | |
| | | LOW / MED / HIGH | |

**CURB PRINCIPLE:** Best setups have LOW visibility — they seem like throwaway details.

### 3.2 Payoff Tracking

For each setup, verify payoff exists:

```
PAYOFF_VALIDITY_TEST:
  FOR each setup:
    1. Is payoff present? → If NO, setup is abandoned (error)
    2. Is payoff proportional? → Bigger setup = bigger payoff expected
    3. Is payoff surprising? → Audience should not predict exact form
    4. Is payoff inevitable? → In retrospect, it "had to" happen this way

  SCORING:
    All 4 criteria met = Strong payoff
    2-3 criteria met = Functional payoff
    0-1 criteria met = Payoff failure
```

| Setup | Present? | Proportional? | Surprising? | Inevitable? | Score |
|-------|----------|---------------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |

### 3.3 Orphan Detection

Identify elements that appear important but never pay off:

| Orphan Element | Where Introduced | Expected Function | Why Abandoned? |
|----------------|------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| | | | |

**CURB PRINCIPLE:** Zero orphans. Everything pays off or gets cut.

---

## 4. Social Contract Violation Analysis

### 4.1 Social Contract Inventory

What unspoken rules does the draft expose?

| Rule | Statement | Who Violates? | Consequence |
|------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |

**RULE TYPES:**
- `ETIQUETTE` — Manners, politeness norms
- `RECIPROCITY` — Favors, obligations
- `TERRITORY` — Personal space, ownership
- `HIERARCHY` — Status, deference
- `HONESTY` — Truth-telling, disclosure
- `TIMING` — When things are appropriate

### 4.2 Violation Escalation Test

```
ESCALATION_PATTERN:
  INITIAL_VIOLATION (minor breach)
       │
       ▼
  COMPOUNDING_VIOLATION (attempt to fix makes worse)
       │
       ▼
  CATASTROPHIC_VIOLATION (exposure/collision)

  RULE: Each violation must be MORE embarrassing than the last.
  TEST: Can violations be reordered without losing escalation?
        If YES → Escalation is weak
```

Map escalation for protagonist:

| Stage | Violation | Embarrassment Level (1-10) |
|-------|-----------|---------------------------|
| Initial | | |
| Compound 1 | | |
| Compound 2 | | |
| Catastrophic | | |

**VALID if:** Numbers strictly increase
**INVALID if:** Embarrassment plateaus or decreases

### 4.3 The Larry Paradox Test

```
LARRY_PARADOX:
  Is the protagonist TECHNICALLY CORRECT but SOCIALLY WRONG?

  PATTERN:
    - Protagonist identifies genuine hypocrisy/absurdity
    - Protagonist acts on correct observation
    - Social consequences are disastrous
    - Audience agrees with logic but cringes at execution

  IF paradox present: Curb-aligned
  IF protagonist simply wrong: Different genre
  IF protagonist succeeds: Not comedy
```

**Draft Examples:**

| Situation | Technically Correct Because... | Socially Wrong Because... |
|-----------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
| | | |
| | | |

---

## 5. Causal Binding Analysis

### 5.1 BUT/THEREFORE/AND THEN Test

Analyze scene-to-scene connections:

```
CONNECTORS:
  THEREFORE → Causal (strong): A happens, THEREFORE B happens
  BUT       → Consequential (strong): A happens, BUT B complicates
  AND THEN  → Sequential (weak): A happens, AND THEN B happens (no causality)

CURB TARGET: 80%+ THEREFORE/BUT connectors
CURB FAILURE: 50%+ AND THEN connectors
```

**Scene Connection Analysis:**

| Scene A | → | Scene B | Connector |
|---------|---|---------|-----------|
| | | | THEREFORE / BUT / AND THEN |
| | | | THEREFORE / BUT / AND THEN |
| | | | THEREFORE / BUT / AND THEN |
| | | | THEREFORE / BUT / AND THEN |
| | | | THEREFORE / BUT / AND THEN |

**Ratio Calculation:**
- THEREFORE/BUT: _____ / _____ total = _____%
- AND THEN: _____ / _____ total = _____%

### 5.2 Retroactive Inevitability Test

```
INEVITABILITY_TEST:
  READ story backward from catastrophe.

  AT each step, ask:
    "Given what came before, could this have gone differently?"

  IF yes at any point: Causal chain has weak link
  IF no throughout: Collision is inevitable

  NOTE: "Inevitable" ≠ "predictable"
        Audience should NOT see it coming
        Audience SHOULD think "of course" after
```

---

## 6. Character Stasis Verification

### 6.1 No Learning Test

```
CHARACTER_STASIS_TEST:
  FOR protagonist:
    opening_state = (beliefs, behaviors, relationships)
    closing_state = (beliefs, behaviors, relationships)

    IF opening_state == closing_state:
      RETURN: VALID (no hugging, no learning)

    IF protagonist has "learned lesson":
      RETURN: VIOLATION (this isn't a Curb story)

    IF protagonist is "better person":
      RETURN: VIOLATION (comedy requires stasis)
```

**Draft Assessment:**

| Character | Opening State | Closing State | Changed? |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|----------|
| | | | YES / NO |
| | | | YES / NO |

**CURB REQUIREMENT:** Main characters must NOT change.

### 6.2 The Reset Test

Could this story happen again with the same characters making the same mistakes?

- [ ] YES — Characters would repeat behavior (VALID)
- [ ] NO — Characters have grown (VIOLATION)

---

## 7. Embarrassment Economics

### 7.1 Embarrassment Ledger

Track accumulated social damage:

| Scene | Violation | Embarrassment Deposit | Running Total |
|-------|-----------|----------------------|---------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | FINAL: |

### 7.2 Witness Multiplier

```
WITNESS_EFFECT:
  embarrassment_level = base_violation × witness_count × witness_status

  WITNESS_STATUS_MULTIPLIERS:
    Stranger:        1.0x
    Acquaintance:    1.5x
    Friend:          2.0x
    Family:          2.5x
    Authority:       3.0x
    Romantic Interest: 3.5x
    All of the above: CATASTROPHIC

  CURB PRINCIPLE: Maximum embarrassment requires maximum witnesses
```

Does the catastrophe occur with maximum witnesses present?
- [ ] YES — Climax achieves full embarrassment potential
- [ ] NO — Witnesses could be added for greater impact

### 7.3 Escape Route Elimination

```
ESCAPE_TEST:
  At catastrophe, does protagonist have ANY way out?

  EXIT_TYPES:
    - Lie (discovered/impossible)
    - Leave (blocked/would confirm guilt)
    - Explain (makes it worse)
    - Apologize (refused/insufficient)

  VALID catastrophe: All exits closed
  WEAK catastrophe: Exit available but not taken
```

## 9. Protocol-Specific Revision Prompts

Based on diagnostic results, address the following:

### If Thread Architecture Weak:
- Can you identify a B-story that seems unrelated to A?
- What element could bridge them? (Location, object, person)
- Map the collision point: Where must all threads converge?

### If Setup/Payoff Incomplete:
- List every introduced element; verify payoff for each
- For orphans: Either add payoff or cut the setup
- For visible setups: Can you bury them deeper in scene business?

### If Social Contract Violations Missing:
- What social rules do your characters follow unconsciously?
- What would happen if protagonist violated that rule?
- What would make the violation technically justified but socially disastrous?

### If Causal Binding Weak:
- Rewrite scene transitions with explicit THEREFORE/BUT
- Eliminate AND THEN connections or add causal links
- Work backward from catastrophe: What HAD to happen for this to occur?

### If Characters Learn:
- Delete growth moments
- Replace epiphany with doubled-down bad behavior
- End with character making the exact same mistake

### If Embarrassment Doesn't Escalate:
- Add witnesses at catastrophe
- Close escape routes one by one
- Ensure each violation is worse than the last

## 10. Application Notes for *Open View*

**Surveillance as Witness:** The ever-present camera system = infinite witnesses = maximum embarrassment multiplier at all times.

**Family as Social Contract:** Multi-generational household = dense network of unspoken rules about space, privacy, hierarchy.

**Smart Home as Setup Factory:** Every automated system (faucet, timer, camera) is a planted element that should pay off.

**Clone/Double as Thread Collision:** If characters have doubles (Emma/Beth), their independent storylines must collide in a way that exposes both.
