# Genre Architecture Worksheet
## Character-Genre Mapping & Collision Design

> A dedicated worksheet for screenplays employing **genre multiplicity**—where each character inhabits their own genre register and collision between characters becomes collision between genres.

## 0. Meta-Principles

| Axiom | Formulation |
|-------|-------------|
| GM-A0 | **Genre is costume, not body.** The same structural character can wear different genre "clothes" while maintaining consistent psychology. |
| GM-A1 | **Genre collision is character collision.** When characters meet, their genres meet; the scene's tone emerges from negotiation or domination. |
| GM-A2 | **Genre fluidity is not genre confusion.** Intentional shifts differ from accidental tonal drift; map both to distinguish. |
| GM-A3 | **All genres serve the meta-genre.** Individual genre registers exist within a containing structure that gives their collision meaning. |
| GM-A4 | **Genre awareness varies.** Some characters know they're "in a genre"; others are oblivious. This asymmetry creates dramatic irony. |

## 1. Genre Lexicon

### 1.1 Available Genre Registers

Define the genres active in your screenplay:

| Genre | Core Characteristics | Tonal Markers | Prose Texture |
|-------|---------------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Melodrama** | Heightened emotion, moral clarity, fate | Lush description, weather as mood, significant objects | Sensory, tactile, flowing sentences |
| **Thriller** | Information asymmetry, paranoia, stakes | Withholding, misdirection, ticking clocks | Clipped, suspicious, interrogative |
| **Rom-Com** | Miscommunication, meet-cute, reconciliation | Charm, awkwardness, rehearsed speeches | Light, dialogue-driven, timing-focused |
| **Corporate Satire** | Meaningless labor, institutional absurdity | Jargon, exhaustion, transactional relationships | Flat affect, ironic distance |
| **Horror** | Dread, the uncanny, bodily violation | Darkness, isolation, wrongness | Visceral, present-tense intensity |
| **Competition Reality** | Elimination, performance, judgment | Waiting, names called, sudden departures | Kinetic crowds, individual focus |
| **Domestic Gothic** | Home as threat, family secrets, decay | Storms, decay, the familiar made strange | Architectural, temporal, ancestral |
| **Mumblecore** | Aimlessness, authenticity, anti-drama | Overlapping dialogue, naturalism | Halting, unpolished, observational |

### 1.2 Custom Genre Registers

Define any additional genres specific to your project:

| Genre | Core Characteristics | Tonal Markers | Prose Texture |
|-------|---------------------|---------------|---------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |

## 2. Character-Genre Assignment

### 2.1 Primary Genre Mapping

Assign each character their "home genre"—the register they default to when alone or comfortable:

| Character | Home Genre | Evidence (Scenes/Lines) | What This Genre Protects Them From |
|-----------|------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

### 2.2 Genre Fluency Assessment

Can characters operate in genres other than their home genre?

| Character | Home Genre | Can Access | Cannot Access | Notes |
|-----------|------------|------------|---------------|-------|
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

**Fluency Levels:**
- `NATIVE` — This is their home genre
- `FLUENT` — Can operate comfortably when required
- `BROKEN` — Can attempt but sounds "off"
- `ZERO` — Cannot function in this register at all

### 2.3 Genre Awareness Matrix

Does the character know what genre they're in?

| Character | Aware of Own Genre? | Can Identify Others' Genres? | Believes Genre is Reality? |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| | YES / NO / PARTIAL | YES / NO / PARTIAL | YES / NO |
| | YES / NO / PARTIAL | YES / NO / PARTIAL | YES / NO |

**Awareness Types:**
- `META-AWARE` — Knows they're performing a genre (can break fourth wall)
- `INTUITIVE` — Senses something is "off" about other characters
- `OBLIVIOUS` — Believes their genre is objective reality
- `RESISTANT` — Actively fights against genre assignment

---

## 3. Scene-Level Genre Dynamics

### 3.1 Solo Scene Genre Audit

When a character is alone, what genre governs?

| Scene | Character(s) Alone | Governing Genre | Genre Markers Present |
|-------|-------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |

**Principle:** Solo scenes should be "pure genre"—the character's home register without interference.

### 3.2 Two-Character Scene Genre Negotiation

When two characters share a scene, whose genre dominates?

| Scene | Character A (Genre) | Character B (Genre) | Dominant Genre | Negotiation Type |
|-------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------|------------------|
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

**Negotiation Types:**
- `DOMINATION` — One genre completely overtakes the other
- `BLEND` — Genres merge into hybrid tone
- `OSCILLATION` — Scene shifts between genres beat by beat
- `CLASH` — Genres refuse to integrate; dissonance is the point
- `SURRENDER` — One character abandons their genre

### 3.3 Multi-Character Scene Complexity

For scenes with 3+ characters:

| Scene | Characters Present | Genre Contributions | Resultant Tone |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| | A: / B: / C: | | |

**Complexity Patterns:**
- `COALITION` — Two genres ally against third
- `FREE-FOR-ALL` — No genre dominates; chaos
- `HIERARCHY` — Clear genre pecking order emerges
- `SYNTHESIS` — New meta-genre emerges from combination

## 4. Genre Collision Architecture

### 4.1 Collision Map

Visualize which genres collide at which story points:

```
ACT I:    [Genre A] ←——→ [Genre B]    (First collision)
                 ↘     ↙
ACT II:         [Hybrid/Clash]
                     ↓
          [Genre C] enters
                     ↓
ACT III:  [A + B + C] ←——→ [Meta-Genre Resolution]
```

**Draft-Specific Map:**

```
[Draw your collision architecture here]
```

### 4.2 Collision Consequence Tracking

What happens after genres collide?

| Collision | Genres Involved | Winner/Loser/Draw | Consequence for Characters |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| 1 | | | |
| 2 | | | |
| 3 | | | |
| CLIMAX | | | |

### 4.3 The Climax Genre Question

What genre governs the climax?

| Option | Description | Implications |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Single Genre Victory** | One genre "wins" and governs climax | That genre's values are validated |
| **Synthesis** | Genres merge into new hybrid | Story proposes new way of seeing |
| **Destruction** | All genres fail simultaneously | Nihilistic/absurdist statement |
| **Meta-Awareness** | Characters realize they're in genres | Metafictional revelation |
| **External Genre** | New genre (meta-genre) emerges | Container becomes visible |

**Draft Choice:** _______________________________

## 5. Genre-Prose Correlation

### 5.1 Prose Texture Mapping

How does prose style shift with genre?

| Genre | Sentence Length | Sensory Density | Dialogue/Action Ratio | Vocabulary Register |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Melodrama | Long, flowing | HIGH | 40/60 | Elevated, emotional |
| Thriller | Clipped, staccato | MEDIUM | 30/70 | Technical, suspicious |
| Rom-Com | Variable, rhythmic | LOW | 70/30 | Casual, witty |
| Satire | Flat, deadpan | LOW | 50/50 | Jargon, ironic |
| Horror | Present-tense, immediate | HIGH (visceral) | 20/80 | Body, violation |

### 5.2 Draft Prose Analysis

Sample a passage from each character's solo or dominated scene:

| Character | Genre | Prose Sample | Genre Markers Present |
|-----------|-------|--------------|----------------------|
| | | "[Quote from draft]" | |
| | | "[Quote from draft]" | |

### 5.3 Prose Drift Detection

Identify moments where prose doesn't match assigned genre:

| Location | Expected Genre | Actual Prose Style | Intentional or Drift? |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| | | | INTENTIONAL / DRIFT |
| | | | INTENTIONAL / DRIFT |

**Drift = Error** (unintentional tonal inconsistency)
**Intentional = Signal** (genre shift, character exposure, collision)

---

## 6. Genre × Character Psychology

### 6.1 Why This Character, This Genre?

For each character, explain the psychological fit:

| Character | Home Genre | Psychological Reason | What Would Break Them Out? |
|-----------|------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |

**Principle:** Genre isn't arbitrary assignment—it reflects how the character processes reality.

### 6.2 Genre as Defense Mechanism

| Character | What Genre Protects Against | What Happens If Genre Fails |
|-----------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| | | |
| | | |

**Example:** A rom-com character uses "everything will work out" to avoid confronting genuine loss. When genre fails, they must face grief without comedic armor.

### 6.3 Character Arc × Genre Arc

Does the character's genre shift across the story?

| Character | Opening Genre | Midpoint Genre | Closing Genre | Arc Meaning |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

**Possible Arcs:**
- `STABLE` — Same genre throughout (character doesn't change)
- `SHIFT` — Moves from one genre to another (transformation)
- `EXPANSION` — Gains fluency in additional genres (growth)
- `LOSS` — Loses ability to maintain home genre (breakdown)
- `TRANSCENDENCE` — Becomes meta-aware of genre (enlightenment)

## 9. Revision Prompts

### If Assignment Unclear:
- Write a one-paragraph "genre bio" for each character
- What movies would this character star in?
- What movies would this character refuse to watch?

### If Collisions Weak:
- For each character pair, write a scene where they argue about tone
- Whose worldview would win if they were the only two people left?
- What would each character say about the other's "way of seeing"?

### If Prose Inconsistent:
- Read each character's scenes aloud with appropriate "voice"
- Identify the 3 prose markers that define each genre in YOUR voice
- Rewrite drift passages with intentional genre markers

### If Meta-Structure Missing:
- What is the "camera's genre"—how does the screenplay itself see the world?
- If the characters discovered they were each in different genres, what would they do?
- What genre does the ENDING belong to?

## 10. Application Template: *Open View* Third Draft

### Preliminary Mapping

| Character | Assigned Genre | Evidence | Psychological Fit |
|-----------|---------------|----------|-------------------|
| Emma | Domestic Gothic / Melodrama | Americana kitchen, storm clouds, blood in drain, "mournful sip" | Uses heightened domestic ritual to process absence/loss |
| Beth | Psychological Thriller | Withholding information, "I wanted to make sure you actually hear what I have to say" | Uses information control to maintain power in relationships |
| Clipper | Romantic Comedy / Workplace Drama | Rehearsing pitch, wounded by rejection, "A gentleman should probably wait" | Uses charm and performance to avoid direct vulnerability |
| Helen | Corporate Satire / Mumblecore | "Why do we even work?" / "Cause there's nothing else to do," device addiction | Uses ironic distance and exhaustion to avoid engagement |
| Dayla | Competition Reality | Waiting room, names called, disappearance | Uses competition frame to give meaning to precarity |

### Clone Question

Emma and Beth are described as "clones of one another" with different "avatars." This suggests:

| Interpretation | Implication for Genre Architecture |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| Literal clones | Same "source" character wearing different genre costumes |
| Metaphorical | Genre IS the only difference between them |
| Performative | They choose their genres; genres are masks |

### Meta-Genre Hypothesis

The meta-genre containing all these character-genres appears to be **SURVEILLANCE/SIMULATION**:
- All characters are performing (for someone)
- The smart home "watches" and "responds"
- The performance studio literalizes the "everyone is on stage" premise
- Genre becomes the costume you wear when you know you're being watched

## Quick Reference Card

### Genre Assignment Questions
```
1. What movies would this character be in?
2. What does this genre protect them from?
3. What would break them out of this genre?
```

### Collision Types
```
DOMINATION — One genre wins
BLEND — Genres merge
OSCILLATION — Genres alternate
CLASH — Genres refuse integration
SURRENDER — One character abandons genre
```

### Warning Signs
```
✗ Genre assignment feels arbitrary (no psychological fit)
✗ One genre dominates throughout (not multiplicity)
✗ Genres never collide (parallel, not integrated)
✗ Prose doesn't shift with genre (assignment without execution)
✗ No meta-genre container (chaos, not architecture)
```

### Genre Arc Types
```
STABLE → No change (stasis)
SHIFT → One genre to another (transformation)
EXPANSION → Gains new genre fluency (growth)
LOSS → Can't maintain home genre (breakdown)
TRANSCENDENCE → Becomes meta-aware (enlightenment)
```
