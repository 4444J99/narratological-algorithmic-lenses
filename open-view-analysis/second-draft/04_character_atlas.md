## II. Character Profiles

### MOM

**Role:** Protagonist

**First Appearance:** Line 5 (kitchen scene)

**Last Appearance:** Line 3777 (parallel hell: empty family dinner)

**Scene Count:** 42 scenes (~54% of total)

**Dialogue Volume:** ~28% of total dialogue

---

#### Arc Classification

- [x] **Transformational** — Character changes internally through the narrative
- [x] **Revelational** — Character's true nature is gradually revealed (no change)
- [ ] **Static/Flat** — Character serves function without change or revelation

*Mom's arc is hybrid: she transforms from passive secret-keeper to active killer, while this transformation reveals her underlying capacity for violence/control that was always present.*

#### Opening State

Mom manages the household while drinking, following voice commands from the smart house, and maintaining family functions no one appreciates. She hides her pregnancy/clone-baby (NEW SON) in the basement tank and has been consulting lawyers about giving the baby away to her sister.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Secret-keeper (baby, dissatisfaction, alcoholism)
- Conflict-avoidant (can't tell Dad about baby; can't tell Auntie final answer)
- Domestic manager (cooks, commands house, organizes family)
- Emotionally isolated (performs motherhood without receiving reciprocal care)

**Presenting Problem:**
Mom carries the family's emotional labor without support. Her husband is absent (emotionally and physically), her children are strangers to her, and she manages by suppressing her own needs. The baby in the basement literalizes her secret self.

#### Transformation/Revelation Arc

```
OPENING STATE                    CATALYST                      CLOSING STATE
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Passive secret-keeper     →     Game announcement +     →     Active eliminator +
managing dysfunction            NEW SON's death               eternal isolation
Suppresses own needs            Forces impossible choices     Expresses through violence
Maintains family facade         Facade destroyed              No family to maintain
```

**Key Transformation Beats:**

| Beat | Line | Event | Internal Shift |
|------|------|-------|----------------|
| Catalyst | 2339-2367 | NEW SON boiled alive; first death | Mom's secret destroyed; maternal failure made literal |
| First Test | 2506-2575 | Finds Son, learns about explosives | Must choose between children's safety |
| Midpoint Shift | 2929-2974 | Dad dies | Last adult ally eliminated; sole protector role |
| Dark Night | 3108-3130 | Sis asks "Why should I survive?" | No answer; Mom's sacrifice has no meaning |
| Final Choice | 3131-3179 | Self-harm duel; attempts suicide to ensure Sis wins | Chooses self-destruction as final act of control |

#### Want vs. Need Analysis

**WANT (Conscious Goal):**
To maintain the family—keep them together, fed, functioning—while managing her secret (the baby she plans to give away).

**NEED (Unconscious Necessity):**
To be seen, acknowledged, and cared for; to stop performing motherhood and be allowed to have needs of her own.

**Relationship:**
- [ ] Want and Need aligned
- [x] Want and Need opposed
- [ ] Want only

*Mom's want (maintain family) directly opposes her need (be seen). She can only be seen by destroying the family.*

**Resolution:**
- [ ] Need achieved
- [x] Need rejected
- [ ] Need partially achieved
- [ ] N/A

*Mom's need is never met. Her final sacrifice is another form of erasure—she dies so Sis can live, but her death has no witness who can understand it. In the coda, she exists in an empty family dinner, eternally unseen.*

#### Closing State

Mom is trapped in a parallel hell: family gatherings where she sits alone, four empty chairs, relatives gossiping about her. She texts Dad; he doesn't respond. The domestic labor she performed is now performed on her—she is managed, observed, discussed, but never seen.

**Evidence of Transformation:**
- Lines 2976-3000: Mom systematically kills remaining survivors (Uncle, Sidekick, Leader)—transformation from passive to active, from manager to eliminator
- Lines 3131-3179: Self-harm duel—Mom competes with Sis to die first, expressing love as violence/control

---

#### Relationship Map

| Character | Relationship Type | Opening Dynamic | Closing Dynamic | Shift |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|
| DAD | Spouse (estranged) | Emotional distance; she covers for him | He dies; she mourns briefly | ↓ Loss |
| SIS | Mother-daughter | Distance; mutual disappointment | Connected through violence; Mom sacrifices for Sis | ↑ Tragic intimacy |
| SON | Mother-son | Distance; cryptic warnings | She discovers his secrets too late; he dies | ↓ Loss |
| NEW SON | Mother-clone | Secret; ambivalent attachment | He dies first; her secret destroyed | ↓ Loss |
| AUNTIE | Sisters | Complicit in baby scheme; dependency | Auntie blames Mom; Mom survives Auntie | ↓ Ruptured |
| HOME | Managed/Manager | She commands the house; house responds | House commands her death; she obeys by dying | ↓ Subjugated |

#### Key Scenes

| Scene | Line | Function in Character Arc |
|-------|------|---------------------------|
| Kitchen opening | 5-55 | Introduction: domestic labor, secrets, smart-house |
| Lawyer consultation | 268-333 | Catalyst: learns she needs Dad's permission for baby |
| Beach confession attempt | 943-998 | Test: can't tell Dad the truth |
| Game announcement | 2281-2337 | Crisis: family trapped; game begins |
| NEW SON's death | 2339-2367 | Catalyst: her secret destroyed publicly |
| Finding Son with explosives | 2506-2575 | Choice: must manage impossible situation |
| Systematic killing | 2976-3000 | Transformation: passive to active |
| "Why should I survive?" | 3108-3130 | Dark Night: no answer to offer |
| Self-harm duel | 3131-3179 | Final Choice: death as love/control |

#### Diagnostic Assessment

| Question | Answer | Note |
|----------|--------|------|
| Does this character have a clearly defined want? | Yes | Maintain family; protect secret |
| Does this character have a clearly defined need (distinct from want)? | Yes | To be seen/cared for |
| Does the character make meaningful choices? | Yes | Killing survivors; self-sacrifice |
| Do the character's choices have consequences? | Yes | Sis survives because of Mom's actions |
| Does the character change OR meaningfully reveal? | Yes | Transforms from passive to active killer |
| Is the character necessary to the narrative? | Yes | Protagonist; driver of emotional throughline |
| Could this character be combined with another? | No | — |
| Is this character's voice distinct? | Partial | Formal, restrained; sometimes indistinct from Auntie |

**Character Health Score:** ●●●●○ (Strong)

*Mom is the script's most fully realized character. Her arc is coherent, her transformation earned through accumulating pressure, and her final state thematically resonant. Minor issue: voice distinctiveness could be sharpened.*

---

### DAD

**Role:** Major Supporting (secondary protagonist in Movement III)

**First Appearance:** Line 59 (restaurant with Work-Friend)

**Last Appearance:** Line 3564 (childhood flashback: ball pit assault)

**Scene Count:** 24 scenes (~31%)

**Dialogue Volume:** ~19% of total dialogue

---

#### Arc Classification

- [x] **Transformational** — Character changes internally through the narrative
- [x] **Revelational** — Character's true nature is gradually revealed

*Dad transforms from emotionally absent to violently present, while the script reveals the childhood trauma underlying his dysfunction.*

#### Opening State

Dad dines with a work colleague (future affair partner), unable to connect authentically. He's sexually frustrated, emotionally distant, and seeking escape from family responsibilities. He takes beach vacations alone and cries in public.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Emotionally absent (physically and psychologically avoidant)
- Sexually dysfunctional (impotence, inappropriate arousal patterns)
- Prone to sudden emotional/violent outbursts
- Self-pitying ("When do I get to go on vacation?")

**Presenting Problem:**
Dad cannot be present in his own life. He performs family man while seeking escape. His sexual dysfunction literalizes his inability to connect.

#### Transformation/Revelation Arc

```
OPENING STATE                    CATALYST                      CLOSING STATE
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Avoidant, impotent,       →     Assault on "Mom Clone" +  →   Violent, present,
seeking escape                   Love; returns beaten          dead protecting family
                                                               + trapped in childhood loop
```

**Key Transformation Beats:**

| Beat | Line | Event | Internal Shift |
|------|------|-------|----------------|
| Catalyst | 1255-1318 | Assaults "Mom Clone" and Love | Violence erupts from impotence |
| First Test | 1868-2033 | Returns home; Auntie/Uncle arrive | Must face consequences |
| Midpoint Shift | 2106-2166 | Argues with Mom in basement | Confronts the secret he ignored |
| Dark Night | 2506-2575 | Learns about Son's explosives | His son's secrets mirror his own |
| Final Choice | 2929-2974 | Kills Boss; dies fighting | Chooses violence as protection |

#### Want vs. Need Analysis

**WANT (Conscious Goal):**
Escape—from family, responsibility, his own inadequacy. He wants vacation, affairs, distance.

**NEED (Unconscious Necessity):**
To process childhood trauma and become capable of presence/connection.

**Resolution:**
- [ ] Need achieved
- [x] Need rejected
- [ ] Need partially achieved
- [ ] N/A

*Dad never processes his trauma. His violence is reactive, not transformative. In the coda, he's trapped in the moment of childhood assault—eternally re-experiencing the wound he couldn't integrate.*

#### Closing State

Dad exists in a childhood loop: naptime at kindergarten, friends sneaking outside, sexual assault in the ball pit. The script implies this was his formative wound—the origin of his sexual dysfunction and emotional absence. His "afterlife" is eternal re-traumatization.

**Evidence of Change/Revelation:**
- Lines 1255-1318: Violence against "Mom Clone" reveals capacity for assault
- Lines 2929-2974: Dies fighting for family—finally present, but too late
- Lines 3348-3564: Childhood flashback reveals origin of dysfunction

---

#### Relationship Map

| Character | Relationship Type | Opening Dynamic | Closing Dynamic | Shift |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|
| MOM | Spouse (estranged) | Avoidance; performs marriage | Brief violent protection; dies | — Tragic |
| LOVE | Affair partner | Sexual pursuit; can't perform | Assaults her; abandons | ↓ Violent rupture |
| SON | Father-son | Distant; no communication | Learns of Son's death; carries body | ↓ Loss |
| SIS | Father-daughter | Absent | Brief contact in game | — Minimal |
| WORK-FRIEND/LOVE | Affair partner | Flirtation | Violence | ↓ Destroyed |

#### Diagnostic Assessment

| Question | Answer | Note |
|----------|--------|------|
| Does this character have a clearly defined want? | Yes | Escape, sexual function |
| Does this character have a clearly defined need? | Partial | Trauma processing implied but not explicit until coda |
| Does the character make meaningful choices? | Yes | Assault, return, final fight |
| Do the character's choices have consequences? | Yes | Violence begets violence; dies protecting family |
| Does the character change OR meaningfully reveal? | Yes | Reveals violence; reveals childhood trauma |
| Is the character necessary to the narrative? | Yes | Represents patriarchal failure; his death shifts power |
| Could this character be combined with another? | No | — |
| Is this character's voice distinct? | Partial | Self-pitying; but can blur with Uncle |

**Character Health Score:** ●●●○○ (Competent)

*Dad's arc is thematically rich but underexplored in execution. The childhood revelation comes too late (Movement VI coda) to inform our understanding of his earlier behavior. Consider planting this earlier—a flashback during the assault sequence, perhaps.*

---

### SIS

**Role:** Major Supporting → Inheriting Protagonist (Movement VI)

**First Appearance:** Line 137 (auditorium, seeking scene partner)

**Last Appearance:** Line 3777 (cast as "Auntie" in new show)

**Scene Count:** 22 scenes (~28%)

**Dialogue Volume:** ~15% of total dialogue

---

#### Arc Classification

- [ ] **Transformational** — Character changes internally through the narrative
- [x] **Revelational** — Character's true nature is gradually revealed
- [ ] **Static/Flat** — Character serves function without change or revelation

*Sis doesn't transform so much as endure. What's revealed is her capacity for survival—and the price of that survival.*

#### Opening State

Sis is an aspiring actress trapped in typecast roles, hazed by peers, victimized by industry exploitation (leaked photos). She seeks recognition and agency in a system designed to deny both.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Aspiring performer (wants success, recognition)
- Victimized by industry (leaked photos, typecasting, harassment)
- Passive-aggressive with family (vents grievances at worst moments)
- Survivor (demonstrates resilience under pressure)

**Presenting Problem:**
Sis can only get roles that degrade her (frigid mom, overbearing mom) while her actual self is exploited (leaked photos). She's trapped between invisibility and humiliating visibility.

#### Transformation/Revelation Arc

```
OPENING STATE                    CATALYST                      CLOSING STATE
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Aspiring actress         →      Game traps her; family    →   "Winner" of death game;
seeking recognition             dies around her                cast as "Auntie" in sequel
Victim of industry              Becomes sole survivor          Commodity of industry
Typecast                        Witnesses Mom's sacrifice      Cast in ultimate role
```

**Key Transformation Beats:**

| Beat | Line | Event | Internal Shift |
|------|------|-------|----------------|
| Catalyst | 2268-2279 | Arrives in handcuffs; accused of explosives | Criminalized; last to join |
| First Test | 2675-2740 | Finds Son dead under his bed | Confronts family mortality |
| Midpoint Shift | 3001-3078 | Witnesses Mom killing survivors | Understands stakes |
| Dark Night | 3108-3130 | Asks "Why should I survive?" | Articulates meaninglessness |
| Final Choice | 3131-3179 | Competes to die; Mom wins | Forced into survival |

#### Want vs. Need Analysis

**WANT (Conscious Goal):**
Recognition—to be seen as a real actress, not a type. Success on her own terms.

**NEED (Unconscious Necessity):**
Connection with family; authentic relationship vs. performance.

**Resolution:**
- [ ] Need achieved
- [ ] Need rejected
- [x] Need partially achieved
- [ ] N/A

*Sis achieves tragic connection with Mom in their final scene—but it's through violence and sacrifice, not healing. She survives, but survival is conscription into the next cycle.*

#### Closing State

Sis is the "winner"—interviewed, celebrated, immediately cast in a sequel production. In the final image, she's aged up to look like Mom and cast as "Auntie" in the next iteration. Her survival is not escape but transformation into the next cycle's victim/perpetrator.

**Evidence of Revelation:**
- Lines 3108-3130: "Why should I survive this? For what purpose?" reveals existential clarity
- Lines 3620-3658: Cast as "Auntie"—reveals survival as conscription, not freedom

---

#### Relationship Map

| Character | Relationship Type | Opening Dynamic | Closing Dynamic | Shift |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|
| MOM | Daughter-mother | Distance; mutual disappointment | Tragic intimacy; Mom sacrifices for her | ↑ Connection through violence |
| DAD | Daughter-father | Absent | Witnesses his death | — Minimal |
| SON | Sister-brother | Estranged | Finds his body | ↓ Loss |
| THE SHOW | Commodity | Typecast, exploited | "Winner," commodity | — Intensified |

#### Diagnostic Assessment

| Question | Answer | Note |
|----------|--------|------|
| Does this character have a clearly defined want? | Yes | Recognition, success |
| Does this character have a clearly defined need? | Partial | Connection implied but not explicit |
| Does the character make meaningful choices? | Partial | Mostly reactive; final scene has choice |
| Do the character's choices have consequences? | No | Survival forced on her |
| Does the character change OR meaningfully reveal? | Reveal | Capacity for survival revealed |
| Is the character necessary to the narrative? | Yes | Sole survivor; inherits protagonist status |
| Could this character be combined with another? | No | — |
| Is this character's voice distinct? | Partial | Grievance-heavy; sometimes generic young woman |

**Character Health Score:** ●●●○○ (Competent)

*Sis functions structurally (she must survive to complete the cycle) but lacks agency through most of the script. Her passivity is thematically appropriate (survival as conscription) but creates engagement challenges. Consider giving her one clear choice that affects outcomes.*

---

### SON

**Role:** Major Supporting

**First Appearance:** Line 203 (training room, military simulation)

**Last Appearance:** Line 3618 (WWI trench loop)

**Scene Count:** 18 scenes (~23%)

**Dialogue Volume:** ~12% of total dialogue

---

#### Arc Classification

- [x] **Transformational** — Character changes internally through the narrative
- [x] **Revelational** — Character's true nature is gradually revealed

*Son transforms from squad member to conspiracy participant, while his romantic relationship and suicidal ideation are gradually revealed.*

#### Opening State

Son is a military trainee who sacrifices himself in simulations for squad glory. He seeks approval from Leader, his squad commander and secret romantic partner. He hides his relationship and his plans.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Secret-keeper (romance with Leader; explosive materials)
- Self-sacrificing (dies in simulations; wants quick death in game)
- Subordinate (follows Leader, even when jealous)
- Isolated from family (brings Leader home but maintains distance from parents)

**Presenting Problem:**
Son exists in a structure (military, family) where his authentic self (romantic, conspiratorial) must remain hidden. He lives in code.

#### Transformation/Revelation Arc

```
OPENING STATE                    CATALYST                      CLOSING STATE
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Hidden romantic +         →     Game forces revelation;  →    Dead (beaten? suicide?);
conspiracy participant          family discovers secrets       trapped in WWI trench loop
Seeks Leader's approval         Leader endangered             Eternally dying for Leader
```

**Key Transformation Beats:**

| Beat | Line | Event | Internal Shift |
|------|------|-------|----------------|
| Catalyst | 1670-1730 | Handles explosives with Leader | Conspiracy becomes real |
| First Test | 1757-1866 | Fights Leader; nearly strangled | Realizes relationship violence |
| Midpoint Shift | 2184-2262 | Discovered naked with Leader | Secret exposed |
| Dark Night | 2506-2575 | Tells Mom he wants quick death | Suicidal ideation articulated |
| Final Choice | — | Dies (method unclear) | Exits the game on his terms? |

#### Want vs. Need Analysis

**WANT (Conscious Goal):**
Leader's approval; belonging in the squad; success in the conspiracy (undefined goal).

**NEED (Unconscious Necessity):**
Authentic connection with family; escape from structures that require his self-erasure.

**Resolution:**
- [ ] Need achieved
- [x] Need rejected
- [ ] Need partially achieved
- [ ] N/A

*Son never achieves authentic family connection. His death happens off-screen; his afterlife is eternal trench warfare following Leader. He remains subordinate forever.*

#### Closing State

Son exists in a WWI trench loop—following Leader over the top, both getting shot, falling into a spike pit, being patched up for more. His afterlife is eternal re-enactment of his primary pattern: following Leader into death.

**Evidence of Transformation/Revelation:**
- Lines 1670-1730: "wipe out a planet"—reveals conspiracy scale
- Lines 2506-2575: "I want to die quick and fast"—reveals suicidal ideation
- Lines 3566-3618: Trench warfare loop—reveals his pattern as eternal

---

#### Diagnostic Assessment

| Question | Answer | Note |
|----------|--------|------|
| Does this character have a clearly defined want? | Partial | Leader's approval; conspiracy goals unclear |
| Does this character have a clearly defined need? | Partial | Authentic connection implied |
| Does the character make meaningful choices? | Partial | Hides explosives; but conspiracy goal unclear |
| Do the character's choices have consequences? | Yes | Explosives ultimately destroy house |
| Does the character change OR meaningfully reveal? | Reveal | Secrets revealed through pressure |
| Is the character necessary to the narrative? | Yes | Provides explosives; romantic subplot |
| Could this character be combined with another? | No | — |
| Is this character's voice distinct? | No | Often indistinct from Leader |

**Character Health Score:** ●●○○○ (Needs Work)

*Son's arc is structurally important (his explosives are Chekhov's gun) but motivationally opaque. What is the conspiracy's goal? Is his death suicide or murder? The script needs to clarify his intentions to make his arc resonate.*

---

### LEADER

**Role:** Major Supporting

**First Appearance:** Line 203 (training room, commanding squad)

**Last Appearance:** Line 3618 (WWI trench loop with Son)

**Scene Count:** 14 scenes (~18%)

**Dialogue Volume:** ~8% of total dialogue

---

#### Arc Classification

- [ ] **Transformational** — Character changes internally through the narrative
- [x] **Revelational** — Character's true nature is gradually revealed
- [ ] **Static/Flat** — Character serves function without change or revelation

*Leader's authority and romantic involvement are revealed progressively; she doesn't change so much as become visible.*

#### Opening State

Leader is Son's squad commander—authoritative, dismissive, superior. Their romantic relationship exists but is hidden behind military hierarchy.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Authoritative (commands squad; dismisses Son's invitations)
- Secretive (relationship with Son hidden)
- Manipulative (uses rank to control Son)
- Violent (physical fight with Son; chokes him)

**Presenting Problem:**
Leader operates in structures (military, family) that require her to dominate. Her relationship with Son is constrained by hierarchy.

#### Transformation/Revelation Arc

```
OPENING STATE                    CATALYST                      CLOSING STATE
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Squad commander +         →     Police seek her;          →    Killed by Mom;
hidden romantic                 discovered with Son            trapped in trench loop with Son
Dominant in hierarchy           Loses authority                Subordinate to death
```

#### Want vs. Need Analysis

**WANT:** Authority, control, successful execution of conspiracy
**NEED:** Authentic partnership (not hierarchy) with Son

**Resolution:** Need rejected—dies without achieving authentic connection

#### Closing State

Leader is killed by Mom (to save Sis). In the coda, she shares Son's trench loop—eternally leading him over the top, both dying together. Their hierarchy persists in death.

#### Diagnostic Assessment

| Question | Answer | Note |
|----------|--------|------|
| Does this character have a clearly defined want? | Partial | Conspiracy goals unclear |
| Does this character have a clearly defined need? | No | Underdeveloped |
| Does the character make meaningful choices? | Partial | Conspiracy; relationship |
| Do the character's choices have consequences? | Yes | Her conspiracy brings police |
| Does the character change OR meaningfully reveal? | Reveal | Romantic relationship revealed |
| Is the character necessary to the narrative? | Yes | Catalyst for police arrival; conspiracy partner |
| Could this character be combined with another? | No | — |
| Is this character's voice distinct? | No | Often indistinct from Son |

**Character Health Score:** ●●○○○ (Needs Work)

*Leader functions as plot catalyst but lacks interiority. Her motivation for the conspiracy is never explained. Consider one scene from her POV that clarifies her stakes.*

---

### AUNTIE

**Role:** Major Supporting

**First Appearance:** Line 5 (O.S., on phone with Mom)

**Last Appearance:** Line 3001-3078 (killed by Mom)

**Scene Count:** 10 scenes (~13%)

**Dialogue Volume:** ~7% of total dialogue

---

#### Arc Classification

- [ ] **Transformational**
- [ ] **Revelational**
- [x] **Static/Flat** — Character serves function without change or revelation

*Auntie functions as Mom's mirror and moral antagonist—what Mom could become.*

#### Opening State / Closing State

Auntie begins as Mom's complicit partner in the baby scheme. She wavers, changes her mind, then blames Mom during the game. She dies having contributed nothing but judgment.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Complicit (agrees to take baby; knows Mom's secrets)
- Fickle (changes mind; arrives at house to back out)
- Judgmental (blames Mom during game)

**Want:** Avoid consequences; not be responsible
**Need:** N/A (static character)

---

#### Diagnostic Assessment

| Question | Answer | Note |
|----------|--------|------|
| Does this character have a clearly defined want? | Partial | Wants baby? Doesn't want responsibility |
| Does this character make meaningful choices? | No | Wavers; no consequential choice |
| Is the character necessary to the narrative? | Yes | Provides external pressure on Mom |
| Could this character be combined with another? | No | Represents family outside the house |
| Is this character's voice distinct? | No | Often indistinct from Mom |

**Character Health Score:** ●●○○○ (Needs Work)

*Auntie represents missed opportunity. Her wavering could be developed into genuine moral complexity—she could force Mom to articulate her reasons, creating dramatic confrontation. Currently she's reactive.*

### Power Dynamics Evolution

| Character | Power Position (Open) | Power Position (Close) | Trajectory |
|-----------|----------------------|------------------------|------------|
| MOM | Mid (domestic manager) | Low→High→Dead (killer→victim) | ↑↓ Rise then fall |
| DAD | Low (absent, impotent) | Dead | ↓ Falling |
| SIS | Low (exploited) | "Winner" (commodity) | — Stable (low throughout) |
| SON | Low (subordinate) | Dead | ↓ Falling |
| LEADER | High (commander) | Dead | ↓ Falling |
| HOME/SHOW | High (unseen) | High (controls aftermath) | — Stable (dominant) |

### Alliances & Conflicts

**Opening Configuration:**
```
[Mom + Auntie] vs. [Dad (absent)] — baby secret
[Son + Leader] vs. [Family] — conspiracy secret
[Sis] vs. [Industry] — exploitation
[All] vs. [HOME] — surveillance (unconscious)
```

**Closing Configuration:**
```
[Sis] alone vs. [SHOW/cycle] — conscripted into next iteration
[Mom, Dad, Son] each alone in separate hells
```

## V. Character Issues Log

| Character | Issue | Severity | Recommendation |
|-----------|-------|----------|----------------|
| SON | Conspiracy motivation unclear | Critical | Clarify what Son and Leader are planning; give him a scene articulating purpose |
| LEADER | No interior life | Important | One POV scene showing her stakes/motivation |
| SIS | Passive through game | Important | Give her one choice that affects outcome |
| DAD | Childhood trauma revealed too late | Important | Plant earlier (flashback during hotel assault?) |
| AUNTIE | Static; no meaningful choice | Polish | Develop her wavering into genuine conflict |
| MOM/AUNTIE | Voices indistinct | Polish | Differentiate speech patterns |
| SON/LEADER | Voices indistinct | Polish | Differentiate speech patterns |

### Common Issues Checklist

- [ ] Protagonist is passive (things happen TO them) — *Mom is active, especially in climax*
- [ ] Protagonist makes no meaningful choices — *Mom's killing sequence is choice*
- [x] Antagonist lacks comprehensible motivation — *HOME/SHOW operates without explanation*
- [x] Antagonist is absent for long stretches — *No personified antagonist until game*
- [x] Supporting characters are interchangeable — *Auntie/Uncle; Son/Leader voice issues*
- [x] Character voices are not distinct — *See above*
- [ ] Relationships don't evolve — *Mom/Sis relationship evolves*
- [ ] Transformations are unearned — *Mom's transformation is earned*
- [x] Characters exist only to deliver information — *Police, Casting directors*
- [ ] Love interest has no independent function — *N/A*
