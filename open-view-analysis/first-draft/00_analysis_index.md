## Overview

This directory contains the complete P7 COMPREHENSIVE protocol analysis for the first draft of *Open View*, a surveillance-horror screenplay examining family dysfunction through the grammar of perpetual observation.

## Critical Findings Summary

### Structural Issues

1. **FATAL:** Script terminates at Line 2810, mid-third-act
2. **SEVERE:** HQ subplot never integrates with family narrative
3. **HIGH:** Black Box activation lacks causal connection to family actions

### Strengths

1. **Opening quadrant sequence** — Genuinely innovative formal device
2. **Bathroom argument (Lines 412-578)** — Script's best scene; acidic domestic dialogue
3. **Li's violence against Def** — Effective midpoint recontextualization
4. **Lef's death sequence** — Emotionally devastating climax moment

### Character Arc Status

| Character | Arc Completion | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Li | 40% | Complicity reveal unfinished |
| Fre | 35% | Manipulation/drugging sketched only |
| Sus | 30% | Abuse thread dangling |
| Rok | 25% | Sexuality never resolved |
| Lef | 100% | Dies (only complete arc) |
