      "statement": "The human face is the great subject of the cinema. Everything can be read in the face. The close-up is not merely a technique but an ontological claim: the face is the primary site where interiority becomes visible. Unlike landscape or architecture, the face cannot dissemble completely - micro-expressions betray what words conceal.",
