# The "three things going on" technique for scene construction

Phoebe Waller-Bridge's approach to scene-building—ensuring something always complicates the main action—represents a practical application of one of screenwriting's most enduring principles. Her specific articulation, captured in a **2019 Deadline interview**, provides an accessible, production-ready framework that aligns with decades of established dramatic theory while offering fresh language for implementation.

**Her exact framing**: "I always think there should be at least three things going on in one scene at the same time. I think every actor should know that there are three things this person is dealing with, and usually it's like they're having to eat lunch, or they're having to deal with a really hot room." She elaborated: "I feel like the more you put on a person, the more real it feels, because otherwise it's just a conversation about a bank loan."

## The primary source: Waller-Bridge's craft interviews

The technique surfaced most clearly in a **June 2019 Deadline interview** where Waller-Bridge discussed her work on Fleabag, Killing Eve, and the then-upcoming Bond film. She provided a specific example: the bank loan scene in Fleabag's pilot, where the protagonist arrives "late, completely unprepared, and sweating profusely—causing her to accidentally flash the banker in question, who, by the way, had an issue with sexual harassment recently." When there are "three things going on at the same time, at minimum, I think you instantly have reality."

Additional craft discussions have reinforced this philosophy. In a **July 2020 BAFTA Virtual Masterclass**, she discussed making the Hot Priest "a celibate man because it just made the whole thing even more tense for obvious reasons"—demonstrating how she layers obstacles even at the character-design level. On the **Scriptnotes podcast (Episode 445, April 2020)**, she described constantly "throwing rocks at your characters," particularly funny ones, because "being funny takes a confidence" and the dramatic question becomes "what are you hiding?"

A related technique she articulated: **"disarm then punch"**—"I try to disarm an audience as much as I can with comedy and then punch them in the gut with drama when they least expect it." The complications create the comedy that opens viewers to emotional impact.

## Fleabag demonstrations of the technique

### The bank loan scene (Season 1, Episode 1)
**Main intention**: Secure funding to save her guinea pig café. **Complicating elements**: Arriving late, being unprepared, sweating profusely, wardrobe malfunction that accidentally flashes the banker, the banker's recent sexual harassment scandal making him interpret her exposure as manipulation. What could be straightforward business drama becomes excruciatingly awkward comedy while revealing Fleabag's chaotic, self-sabotaging nature. Waller-Bridge directly cited this scene as an example—"otherwise it's just a conversation about a bank loan."

### The engagement dinner (Season 2, Episode 1)
Critics called this 26-minute single-location episode "a cinematic comedy masterpiece." **Main intention**: Survive a family dinner celebrating her father's engagement to her hated Godmother. **Complicating elements**: Claire hiding a miscarriage, an overly attentive waitress who won't stop interrupting, Martin secretly drinking, Godmother's constant humblebrags, the Hot Priest's presence creating forbidden attraction, the fact that no one has asked Fleabag a question in **45 minutes**. Director Harry Bradbeer structured three "smoke break" escape valves where the tension becomes so unbearable Fleabag must physically leave the table. The editing becomes "absurdly fast for a stationary scene"—cutting between characters' looks captures five simultaneous relationship dynamics.

### The confession booth scene (Season 2, Episode 4)
**Main intention**: Genuinely confess emotional turmoil ("I just want someone to tell me how to live my life, Father"). **Complicating elements**: Being drunk, not being Catholic ("I'm not gonna say that"), the confessional wall physically separating them, mutual forbidden attraction, intrusive memories of Boo, and—at the scene's climax—a painting of Jesus literally falling off the wall with a crash when they begin kissing. The physical comedy interrupts intimacy while the Priest interprets it as divine intervention.

### The therapy session (Season 2, Episode 2)
**Main intention**: Originally to exchange a therapy voucher for cash; ultimately, to avoid genuine vulnerability. **Complicating elements**: Fiona Shaw's therapist has zero tolerance for humor, shutting down Fleabag's deflection attempts ("Tough crowd!"). The therapist moisturizes dry forearms during questioning. Fleabag keeps trying to address the camera—her usual escape valve—but can't escape the therapist's piercing summation: "Just a girl with no friends and an empty heart... by your own description." The obstacle here is someone who refuses to play along with Fleabag's defense mechanisms.

### The Women in Business awards (Season 2, Episode 3)
**Main intention**: Retrieve a stolen statue she accidentally gave as an award replacement. **Complicating elements**: The original award was broken, she panicked and substituted her Godmother's nude sculpture (later revealed to be modeled after Fleabag's mother), and now she must confess this to powerful stranger Belinda. The comic situation creates the space for Kristin Scott Thomas's Emmy-nominated monologue about women and pain—dramatic depth emerging from farcical complications.

## The technique across other creators' work

### Aaron Sorkin: intention and obstacle as "drive shaft"
Sorkin's philosophy most closely mirrors Waller-Bridge's articulation. From his MasterClass: "I worship at the temple of intention and obstacle. Somebody wants something. Something's standing in their way of getting it. They've got to really want it bad, and whatever is standing in their way has got to be formidable. That's what creates friction and tension, and that's what drama is. If you don't have that, then it's journalism."

His walk-and-talk technique (developed with director Thomas Schlamme) creates built-in obstacles: characters must discuss complex issues while physically moving through corridors, making the space itself a complication. Movement becomes obstacle—characters can't stop for a proper conversation; they're racing against time and physical space while doors, other people, and stairs naturally interrupt dialogue.

### Quentin Tarantino: mundane obstacles in unbearable tension
The **Inglourious Basterds opening scene**—which Tarantino called his personal favorite—demonstrates sophisticated obstacle layering. Hans Landa interrogates a farmer about hidden Jews, but the scene unfolds through **eight minutes** of polite conversation, drinking milk, discussing dairy farming, smoking a pipe. The mundane obstacles (hospitality rituals, conversational politeness) delay inevitable violence while we know Jews hide beneath the floorboards. Similarly, the bar scene's **20-minute card game** becomes the stage where a British spy's wrong finger gesture (ordering "three" whiskies with the wrong German counting method) exposes his cover.

### Coen Brothers: cascading physical complications
**Raising Arizona** features a convenience store robbery where the main intention (steal money for family) encounters compounding obstacles: civilians, police, dogs, changing locations in a Looney Tunes-style chase. **Fargo's** Jerry Lundegaard attempts a kidnapping scheme while constantly undermined by his own incompetence—wrong numbers, ice scraper fumbling, car dealership bureaucracy. The Coens call their approach "fantastic realism": ordinary characters in extraordinary situations with exponentially multiplying physical obstacles.

### Fawlty Towers: the perfect escalation engine
John Cleese's scripts ran **135-140 pages** (versus the standard 65) with **400 camera cuts per episode** (versus typical 200), enabling rapid-fire complication escalation. "Gourmet Night" layers obstacles: chef gets drunk, car won't start, wrong food delivered, demanding child wants "proper chips." "The Germans" begins with a botched fire drill that accidentally triggers a burglar alarm, adds a concussion from a frying pan, then an actual fire starts in the kitchen—and when Manuel tries to warn Basil, Basil's trained dismissal prevents him from hearing the real warning.

### Barry: genre collision as obstacle
Bill Hader described Barry's dual-world structure: "The scenes when Barry is in hitman mode are 'high stakes, no drama,' and the scenes when he's with his acting class are 'high drama, no stakes.'" The complication comes from genre itself—striving actors "provide the nervous energy the viewer's likely expecting from Barry's covert activities." Violence becomes slapstick; acting class becomes life-or-death emotional stakes.

### Atlanta: surreal intrusions as obstacles
Donald Glover pitched Atlanta as "Twin Peaks with rappers" and described his approach as "I just Trojan Horsed it... I told FX the show was something it wasn't." The series subverts "at least one expectation in nearly every scene." When an NBA player produces an invisible car and runs over people, or when Black Justin Bieber appears at a celebrity basketball game, these surreal obstacles force viewers to confront their assumptions while preventing any scene from being merely "about what it's about."

## Theoretical foundations from screenwriting pedagogy

### Robert McKee: "The Gap"
McKee's central concept for scene-level conflict: "A substance of story is the gap that splits open between what a human being expects to happen when he takes an action and what really does happen." Any scene where characters get exactly what they expect is "not worth shooting." The protagonist acts expecting a certain response; instead, "forces of antagonism" open a gap between subjective expectation and objective result. This gap IS the drama.

### David Mamet: the three essential questions
Mamet's framework demands every scene answer: **"Who wants what from whom? What happens if they don't get it? Why now?"** His famous memo to writers of The Unit: "EVERY SCENE MUST BE DRAMATIC. THAT MEANS: THE MAIN CHARACTER MUST HAVE A SIMPLE, STRAIGHTFORWARD, PRESSING NEED WHICH IMPELS HIM OR HER TO SHOW UP IN THE SCENE. THEIR ATTEMPT TO GET THIS NEED MET *WILL* LEAD, AT THE END OF THE SCENE, TO *FAILURE*." The obstacle creates the failure that propels forward.

### Blake Snyder: "The Pope in the Pool"
Named after a scene in The Plot to Kill the Pope where exposition unfolds while the Pope swims laps: "We're thinking 'I didn't know the Vatican has a pool?! And look, the Pope's not wearing his Pope clothes'—and before you can say 'Where's my miter?' the scene's over." The technique: have two things going on simultaneously—necessary information plus something visually interesting that distracts. **The Big Short** delivers complex financial concepts via Margot Robbie in a bubble bath; **Jurassic Park** explains DNA replication during a theme park ride.

### John Yorke: fractal structure
Yorke's key insight: story structure is **fractal**—each scene mirrors the whole story's structure with "setup, inciting incidents, crisis points, climax, and resolution." PWB's technique operates at every level: what works for overall plot works for each scene and each beat within scenes. "Come in late, get out early" means entering at crisis points where obstacles are already active.

## Codified protocol: the inconvenient element method

Based on this research, Waller-Bridge's technique can be formalized as a **four-layer scene construction protocol**:

**Layer 1 — Establish the scene's primary intention**: What does the character want or need in this specific scene? This should be concrete and urgent.

**Layer 2 — Introduce physical/environmental obstacles**: What in the space, the body, or the circumstances makes achieving this intention difficult? (Hot room, malfunctioning clothes, being drunk, time pressure, physical barriers, eating, an intrusive third party.)

**Layer 3 — Add interpersonal complications**: Who else is present? What do they want? What secrets are being hidden? What relationship tensions exist beneath the surface dialogue?

**Layer 4 — Ensure the gap between intention and result**: How does the scene end in a state different from what the character expected? What failure or complication propels to the next scene?

The Waller-Bridge test: **Can you identify at least three distinct things the character is dealing with simultaneously?** If not, the scene likely feels "like a conversation about a bank loan"—dramatically inert despite its content.

## Why the technique creates "reality"

Waller-Bridge's insight—"the more you put on a person, the more real it feels"—reflects a fundamental truth about human experience. Real conversations rarely happen in neutral conditions. We negotiate difficult topics while hungry, while late, while someone interrupts, while hiding something, while physically uncomfortable. By encoding these complications into scene construction, writers bypass the artificiality of "two people in a room discussing themes" and generate what feels like authentic human behavior under pressure.

The technique also solves the **show-don't-tell problem**: obstacles force characters to reveal themselves through action rather than declaration. How Fleabag handles the bank manager's suspicion tells us more about her than any self-description could. How Basil Fawlty responds to mounting disasters reveals his character more than exposition ever would.

Finally, obstacles create the **comedy-drama oscillation** that defines contemporary prestige television. The complications generate humor while simultaneously making space for emotional depth—precisely Waller-Bridge's "disarm then punch" approach.

## Conclusion: a unifying framework across dramatic traditions

Waller-Bridge's "three things going on at once" represents the accessible, practitioner-level articulation of principles that McKee calls "the gap," Sorkin calls "the drive shaft," Mamet distills into "what prevents them," and theatrical tradition calls "stage business." The terminology differs; the underlying principle remains constant: **scenes require obstacles to generate drama, reveal character, and propel narrative forward**.

What distinguishes Waller-Bridge's framing is its specificity and practicality. Rather than abstract dramatic theory, she offers a concrete checklist: eating lunch, a hot room, being unprepared, sweating. This granularity makes the principle immediately actionable for writers—not "add conflict" but "add three specific complications your actor must physically navigate while pursuing their objective."

The technique's universality across genres (Tarantino's tension, Coen Brothers' absurdism, British cringe comedy, HBO's prestige violence) suggests it operates at a fundamental level of human storytelling. We watch not to see characters achieve goals smoothly, but to see them navigate the obstacles between intention and result—because that navigation reveals who they really are.
