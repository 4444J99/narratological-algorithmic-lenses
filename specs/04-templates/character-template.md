## II. Character Profiles

### [CHARACTER NAME]

**Role:** Protagonist / Antagonist / Major Supporting / Minor Supporting

**First Appearance:** Line/Page [N]

**Last Appearance:** Line/Page [N]

**Scene Count:** [N] scenes

**Dialogue Volume:** ~[N]% of total dialogue

---

#### Arc Classification

- [x] **Transformational** — Character changes internally through the narrative
- [ ] **Revelational** — Character's true nature is gradually revealed (no change)
- [ ] **Static/Flat** — Character serves function without change or revelation

#### Opening State

[Description of character's situation, worldview, and emotional state at script opening]

**Key Characteristics:**
- [trait]
- [trait]
- [trait]

**Presenting Problem:**
[What's wrong in their life as we meet them?]

#### Transformation/Revelation Arc

```
OPENING STATE                    CATALYST                      CLOSING STATE
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[Description]          →         [Event that              →    [Description]
                                  initiates change]
```

**Key Transformation Beats:**

| Beat | Line/Page | Event | Internal Shift |
|------|-----------|-------|----------------|
| Catalyst | | | |
| First Test | | | |
| Midpoint Shift | | | |
| Dark Night | | | |
| Final Choice | | | |

#### Want vs. Need Analysis

**WANT (Conscious Goal):**
[What the character believes they need and actively pursues]

**NEED (Unconscious Necessity):**
[What the character actually needs for wholeness/growth]

**Relationship:**
- [ ] Want and Need aligned (character knows what they need)
- [x] Want and Need opposed (character must discover true need)
- [ ] Want only (character is static or functional)

**Resolution:**
- [ ] Need achieved (transformational success)
- [ ] Need rejected (tragic arc)
- [ ] Need partially achieved (ambiguous resolution)
- [ ] N/A (static character)

#### Closing State

[Description of character's situation, worldview, and emotional state at script close]

**Evidence of Change/Revelation:**
- [specific behavior or line that demonstrates transformation]
- [specific behavior or line]

#### Relationship Map

| Character | Relationship Type | Opening Dynamic | Closing Dynamic | Shift |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|
| [name] | [type: lover, rival, mentor, etc.] | [description] | [description] | ↑ ↓ — |

#### Key Scenes

| Scene | Line/Page | Function in Character Arc |
|-------|-----------|---------------------------|
| [description] | [N] | Introduction / Catalyst / Test / Revelation / Choice / Transformation |

## Usage Notes

1. **Full profiles for major characters only**: Protagonist, antagonist, and major supporting characters get full profiles. Minor characters get entries in the hierarchy only.

2. **Want vs. Need**: This is often the key to character arc. If you can't articulate both, the character may be underdeveloped.

3. **Relationship map**: Should visualize the script's emotional geometry. Who is connected to whom and how?

4. **Voice distinctiveness**: Read dialogue without speaker tags. If you can't tell who's speaking, voices aren't distinct.

5. **Diagnostic questions**: Answer honestly. Multiple "No" or "Partial" answers indicate character work is needed.

6. **Statistics**: Numbers can reveal imbalances. If protagonist is in only 40% of scenes, is that intentional?

7. **Issues log**: Feeds directly into the Revision Roadmap.
