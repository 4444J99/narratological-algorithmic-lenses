FADE IN:

INT. KITCHEN - DUSK

A wholesome, worn-in and warm, Americana kitchen, complete with outmoded appliances. The cooking timer dial on the oven quietly ticks away, only moments from striking midnight. A round dining table surrounded by five seats, yet only set to serve four individuals. 

EMMA (20s) chops carrots at the counter while whistling a manic rendition of “The Candy Man.” She’s manicured from head to toe. 

She stops in the middle of a melodic line, picks up her martini glass from the counter and takes a long, mournful sip.

Working up the nerve to say it to herself;

EMMA
(bitter)
Probably around then--
Any minute now--
Don’t wait up--

She sets the glass down and returns to slicing vegetables; cooking should be meditative, and she wants to zone out to the rhythmic chopping, however--

The whistle returns, not out of want but because the jingle has possessed her. She decides to fight the ear worm--

Purses her lips, and when her eyes close for a second...

She slices her finger.

Emma hurries to the sink and rinses her wound. The running faucet chases the blood down the drain. From the window above the kitchen sink, the setting sun catches her bouncing blonde curls, then catches her attention--

Outside an endless field of wheat sways in the heavy wind -- a swarm of insects dart across the field, there a second then gone the next. 

Black clouds crawl from behind the house and slowly overtake the sky as the water from the faucet runs...

And runs.

The timer rings out -- Emma snaps out of her daze and jerks to attention, knocking over a metal cocktail shaker.

She huffs, then descends to tend the spill, rag in hand...

As she sops up the vodka and ice the timer keeps ringing and the water keeps running...

The faucet shuts off...

A beat.

EMMA
I said ‘stop’!

The timer stops ringing...but then the faucet turns back on. 

The faucet shuts off hopefully for good as Emma dumps a handful of ice into the sink. Behind her, glasses clink together--but she doesn’t turn to find the source of the sound. Instead, she shakes her head in disappointment.

BETH (20s), Emma’s sister (sat in the one seat without a table setting), fingers the glassware on the table;

BETH
What’s a girl gotta do to get a drink?

Emma didn’t need to be told to mix up new drinks.

EMMA
No longer ringing or writing then. 

BETH
I rang the bell.

Emma delivers a frosted martini glass filled with chilled alcohol to her seated sister. They cheers -- and in this moment that they’re close to one another, the resemblance between them becomes clear: Emma and Beth are clones of one another. Their avatars dress in different accoutrement, their hairstyles aren’t the same, their clothes not alike, but the underlying structure is identical.

EMMA
I can’t say I wasn’t expecting this.

BETH
Don’t say that...Makes me feel like I’m so predicable.

EMMA
Couldn’t you’ve packaged everything you’re about to say nice and neat in a message?

BETH
Then I wouldn’t be able to see your face.
(sip)
And I wanted to make sure you actually hear what I have to say.

EMMA
They’ll be home any minute. Can’t this wait?

BETH
What’s in the oven?

Emma’s eyes widen -- she haphazardly sets her glass down -- hurries over to the oven -- pulls out the burnt and smoking bird -- dumps the baking pan onto the stovetop with a loud clang.

INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT

CLIPPER (20s) sits unaccompanied in a gaudy bamboo booth framed by a backlit picture of Mount Emei. A pufferfish light dangles from a chain in front of him. He’s dressed in a business suit.  He impatiently checks his wristwatch.

Letting out a sharp burst of air, he slouches against the table, and in one quick motion dips a cracker in duck sauce then shoves it in his mouth.

CLIPPER
(chewing, practicing)
The bosses have me leaving tomorrow and assigned me the task of picking a crew to accompany me...and I picked you--oh, who else is coming? I say just the two of us can cover the needs of the entire operation--

.CLIPPER’S POV

staring at the empty seat in front of him, delivering his pitch. Suddenly, a ringtone -- then a picture of Emma pops up and takes over the right-half of the screen. He closes his eyes and the ringtone dies; when he opens his eyes again the picture of Emma disappears.

A waiter approaches the table;

WAITER
Can we get you anything while you wait, sir?

CLIPPER
Good question.
(deliberates)
A gentleman should probably wait, however.

As the waiter turns to walk away--

CLIPPER
Oh, what the hell! I don’t have all night. Get me a--

HELEN (20s) enters in a huff on clip-clopping heels. She takes a seat opposite Clipper. She’s distracted by something on her mobile device.

CLIPPER
(to the Waiter)
Get us a couple of minutes, please.

The waiter departs. After a few moments of silence;

CLIPPER
What a day, huh?

HELEN
Yeah.

CLIPPER
Something hold you up at the office?

Helen, in her own world, mumbles to herself.

CLIPPER
Tell me about it.

Clipper signals to the waiter.

HELEN
I can’t wait to be home.

The waiter approaches;

WAITER
Can we start you off with some drinks?

CLIPPER
Two Zombies, please.

WAITER
Excellent choice.

As the waiter exits, she spurts out:

HELEN
Are those strong?

CLIPPER
Hopefully strong enough.

HELEN
Strong enough for what?

CLIPPER
Strong enough to cleanse us of this day.

Their attention turns to the menus.

Something catches Helen’s eye...

HELEN
These emails are nonstop tonight. Since I stepped out the door. It’s like enough is enough already. Take a break -- it’ll all be there in the morning!

CLIPPER
Right?
(laughing)
Why do we even work?

HELEN
Cause there’s nothing else to do.

The drinks arrive. As the waiter dispenses the drinks;

HELEN
(to Clipper)
Ready to order?

CLIPPER
Would you be interested in sharing something?

HELEN
No.
(to the Waiter)
I’ll have Egg Foo Young. And a to-go box, please.

CLIPPER
I’ll do the Mongolian beef.

The waiter exits. Clipper picks up his glass and holds it up high--

CLIPPER
A toast--

HELEN
An explanation...as to why I’m here?

CLIPPER
(wounded)
Oh.

HELEN
Sorry. That came out wrong.

CLIPPER
It’s fine.

HELEN
It’s been a long day.

CLIPPER
I know.

HELEN
And I need to pack for the Mendelson trip tonight so my mind is all over the place.

CLIPPER
You’re going with Mendelson?

INT. STUDIO

A vast, bright, white, open workspace extends as far and as high as the eye can see. Performers of all calibers, dressed in a vast array of different stage clothes and getups, spread out around the room.

Fencer’s fence -- a female vocal group harmonizes -- a wrestling match goes down.

A swarm of hungry performers stuff themselves on the most delicious spread from the endless catering table.

DAYLA (20s) grabs a glass of champagne from a roaming waiter’s serving tray as she darts her way through the crowd. She’s dressed in white and has a few crumpled papers in her hand.

She’s looking for someone to talk to. Finds them. That person’s name is called, and they disappear.
