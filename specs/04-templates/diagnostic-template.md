## I. Structural Diagnostics

### A. Causal Binding Test (But/Therefore Analysis)

Apply the South Park But/Therefore test to major beat transitions:

**Method:** Between each major beat, insert either BUT, THEREFORE, or AND THEN. BUT and THEREFORE indicate strong causal binding. AND THEN indicates weak/episodic connection.

| Beat Transition | Natural Connector | Assessment |
|-----------------|-------------------|------------|
| Hook â†’ Inciting Incident | | âœ“ / âœ— |
| Inciting Incident â†’ Lock-In | | âœ“ / âœ— |
| Lock-In â†’ Midpoint | | âœ“ / âœ— |
| Midpoint â†’ Crisis | | âœ“ / âœ— |
| Crisis â†’ Climax | | âœ“ / âœ— |
| Climax â†’ Resolution | | âœ“ / âœ— |

**Causal Chain Reconstruction:**
```
[BEAT A]
    â†“ [CONNECTOR]
[BEAT B]
    â†“ [CONNECTOR]
[BEAT C]
    â†“ [CONNECTOR]
[...]
```

**Causal Binding Score:** [N]% of major transitions are causally bound (BUT/THEREFORE)

**Assessment:**
- >80%: Strong binding â€” narrative momentum is inherent
- 60-80%: Adequate binding â€” some episodic elements to address
- 40-60%: Weak binding â€” significant revision needed
- <40%: Fundamental structural issue â€” reconceptualize

### B. Reorderability Test

| Question | Answer | Evidence |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Can Act I scenes be reordered without plot consequence? | Yes / No / Some | [which scenes?] |
| Can Act II scenes be reordered without plot consequence? | Yes / No / Some | [which scenes?] |
| Can Act III scenes be reordered without plot consequence? | Yes / No / Some | [which scenes?] |
| Can acts themselves be reordered? | Yes / No | [explanation] |

**Assessment:** 
If significant reordering is possible without breaking causation, the script has structural looseness. This may be intentional (picaresque, art cinema) or a problem (dramatic narrative).

### C. Necessity Test

For each major scene, ask: If this scene were removed, would the plot still function?

| Scene/Beat | Removable? | Consequence of Removal |
|------------|------------|------------------------|
| [scene] | Yes / No | [what breaks or is lost] |

**Potentially Redundant Scenes:**
- Line/Page [N]: [scene description] â€” [why it may be redundant]

### D. Information Economy Test

| Question | Answer | Evidence |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Does every scene provide new information? | Yes / No | [exceptions] |
| Is any information repeated unnecessarily? | Yes / No | [instances] |
| Are there scenes that could be combined? | Yes / No | [candidates] |
| Is exposition delivered efficiently? | Yes / No | [heavy scenes] |

## II. Character Diagnostics

### A. Protagonist Validation

| Criterion | Met? | Evidence |
|-----------|------|----------|
| Protagonist is the most active agent | Yes / No / Partial | [who drives action?] |
| Protagonist makes choices that drive plot | Yes / No / Partial | [key choices?] |
| Protagonist has a clear conscious goal (WANT) | Yes / No / Partial | [what is it?] |
| Protagonist has an unconscious need (NEED) | Yes / No / Partial | [what is it?] |
| WANT and NEED are distinct | Yes / No | [how?] |
| Protagonist faces escalating obstacles | Yes / No / Partial | [escalation pattern?] |
| Protagonist is transformed or reveals | Yes / No / Partial | [how?] |
| Transformation is earned through action | Yes / No / Partial | [through what?] |

**Protagonist Assessment:**
[Summary of protagonist functionality. If "No" or "Partial" on multiple criteria, this is a structural issue.]

### B. Antagonist Validation

| Criterion | Met? | Evidence |
|-----------|------|----------|
| Antagonist provides genuine opposition | Yes / No / Partial | [how?] |
| Antagonist has comprehensible motivation | Yes / No / Partial | [what drives them?] |
| Antagonist pressure is continuous | Yes / No / Partial | [gaps?] |
| Antagonist is commensurate with protagonist | Yes / No / Partial | [power balance?] |
| Antagonist embodies counter-theme | Yes / No / Partial | [how?] |

**Antagonist Assessment:**
[Summary of antagonist functionality]

### C. Supporting Character Validation

For each major supporting character:

| Character | Necessary? | Distinct Voice? | Arc? | Function Clear? |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|------|-----------------|
| [name] | Yes / No | Yes / No | Yes / No | [function] |

**Characters Potentially Redundant:**
- [name]: Could be combined with [name] or removed because [reason]

## III. Attention Mechanics Diagnostics

From the Attention Mechanics meta-framework:

### A. Involuntary Response Triggers

| Mechanism | Present? | Locations | Assessment |
|-----------|----------|-----------|------------|
| **Comedy (laughter)** | Yes / No | [lines/pages] | Functional / Attempted but failing |
| **Horror (fear)** | Yes / No | [lines/pages] | Functional / Attempted but failing |
| **Pathos (tears)** | Yes / No | [lines/pages] | Functional / Attempted but failing |
| **Suspense (tension)** | Yes / No | [lines/pages] | Functional / Attempted but failing |
| **Surprise (shock)** | Yes / No | [lines/pages] | Functional / Attempted but failing |

**Assessment:**
Is the script relying on involuntary response mechanisms, and are they working?

### B. Prediction Mode

| Mode | Dominant? | Evidence |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Anticipation-Satisfaction** (genre fulfillment) | Yes / No | [how does script set up expectations and deliver?] |
| **Prediction-Failure-Recalibration** (jazz mode) | Yes / No | [how does script subvert and redirect?] |

**Mode Coherence:**
Is the script consistent in its prediction mode, or does it switch without purpose?

### C. Density-Causation Compensation

From ATT-A5: As media become more simultaneous, causation must remain strong.

| Assessment | Rating |
|------------|--------|
| Scene density (events per scene) | Low / Medium / High |
| Causal binding strength | Weak / Moderate / Strong |
| Compensation adequate? | Yes / No |

**Diagnosis:**
If density is high and causation is weak, scenes will feel "busy but empty."
If density is low and causation is weak, scenes will feel "slow and disconnected."

## IV. Identified Issues

### CRITICAL (Structural)

Issues that affect the narrative's fundamental coherence. Must be addressed.

**Issue C1: [Issue Title]**
- **Location:** Lines/Pages [N-N]
- **Description:** [What is wrong?]
- **Evidence:** [Quote or specific reference]
- **Impact:** [Why does this matter?]
- **Suggested Approach:** [Concrete direction for revision]
- **Effort Estimate:** Low / Medium / High

**Issue C2: [...]**

### IMPORTANT (Character/Theme)

**Issue I1: [Issue Title]**
- **Location:** Lines/Pages [N-N]
- **Description:** [What is wrong?]
- **Suggested Approach:** [How to address]

### POLISH (Craft)

- **Location:** Line/Page [N]
- **Note:** [Observation]

## Usage Notes

1. **Causal Binding Test**: This is the single most important diagnostic. If the script fails here, other issues are symptoms.

2. **Binary Questions**: Answer Yes/No/Partial honestly. Partial means "the attempt is visible but incomplete."

3. **Evidence**: Every diagnosis must have textual evidence. "The pacing feels slow" is not a diagnosis; "Scenes 12-18 (pages 34-52) repeat information established in Scene 8" is a diagnosis.

4. **Severity Levels**: 
   - CRITICAL = structural foundation is compromised
   - IMPORTANT = depth and resonance are limited
   - POLISH = craft refinement

5. **Suggested Approaches**: Be specific enough to act on. "Strengthen the protagonist" is not actionable; "Give the protagonist a choice in Scene 14 that directly causes the reversal in Scene 18" is actionable.

6. **Integration**: Issues identified here feed directly into the Revision Roadmap.
