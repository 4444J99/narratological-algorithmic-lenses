# South Park Protocol Worksheet
## Satirical Architecture & Thematic Clarity Analysis

> Derived from Trey Parker & Matt Stone's methodology: the "therefore/but" rule, extreme position stress-testing, satirical inversion, and the 6-day production philosophy of thematic clarity over polish.

---

## 0. Meta-Principles (Axioms)

| Axiom | Formulation |
|-------|-------------|
| TP-A0 | **"I can get away with anything as long as it's funny."** The comedy license permits extreme content, but only if it works as comedy. |
| TP-A1 | **"Therefore" and "But" are the only valid connectors.** No "and then" — every scene must cause or complicate the next. |
| TP-A2 | **Both extremes are usually wrong.** Satire attacks all positions by showing what happens when any position is taken to its logical extreme. |
| TP-A3 | **What is this episode ABOUT?** Every scene must answer to the central thematic question. Cut anything that doesn't. |
| TP-A4 | **The lesson is never the lesson.** Characters who state the moral are usually wrong; the real point emerges from the collision of positions. |

## 1. Structural Hierarchy

```
EPISODE
  └── A-STORY (main plot, carries theme)
        └── B-STORY (parallel/contrast to A)
              └── SCENE (advances ONE of A or B)
                    └── BEAT (must connect via THEREFORE or BUT)
                          └── JOKE (earns license for extreme content)
```

### Definition Table

| Unit | Definition | Constraint |
|------|------------|------------|
| **Theme** | Central question the episode asks | Must be articulable in one sentence |
| **A-Story** | Main plot carrying thematic weight | Every scene must advance theme |
| **B-Story** | Parallel or contrasting plot | Must comment on A-story's theme |
| **Scene** | Discrete dramatic unit | Must connect causally to previous scene |
| **Beat** | Smallest story movement | Connected by THEREFORE or BUT only |

---

## 2. Thematic Architecture

### 2.1 The "What Is This About?" Test

Complete the following in ONE sentence:

**This draft is about:** _____________________________________________

```
CLARITY_TEST:
  Can you explain your story's theme in a single sentence?

  VALID examples:
    - "It's about how both sides of the gun debate are crazy"
    - "It's about how online privacy is a myth we choose to believe"
    - "It's about how family surveillance is love disguised as control"

  INVALID examples:
    - "It's about a family in a smart home" (description, not theme)
    - "It's about lots of things" (no clarity)
    - "It's complicated" (avoidance)

  IF you can't state it clearly: The draft lacks thematic center
```

### 2.2 Scene-Theme Alignment Test

For each scene, answer: **How does this advance the theme?**

| Scene | Theme Connection | VALID / CUT |
|-------|------------------|-------------|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

**SOUTH PARK RULE:** If you can't answer, the scene should be cut or rewritten.

### 2.3 A/B Story Theme Parallelism

```
PARALLELISM_TEST:
  A-STORY explores theme through: _________________________
  B-STORY explores theme through: _________________________

  RELATIONSHIP:
    [ ] PARALLEL — Same theme, different context
    [ ] CONTRAST — Opposite approaches to same question
    [ ] COMMENTARY — B illuminates A's blind spots

  INVALID:
    [ ] UNRELATED — B has nothing to do with A's theme
```

---

## 3. Causal Chain Analysis (THEREFORE/BUT)

### 3.1 The Parker Rule

> "We found out this really simple rule: We can take the beats of your outline, and if the words 'and then' belong between those beats, you're fucked. Basically. You've got something pretty boring. What should happen between every beat you've written is either 'therefore' or 'but.'"

### 3.2 Beat-by-Beat Connector Analysis

Map every beat transition:

| Beat A | Connector | Beat B | VALID? |
|--------|-----------|--------|--------|
| | THEREFORE / BUT / AND THEN | | |
| | THEREFORE / BUT / AND THEN | | |
| | THEREFORE / BUT / AND THEN | | |
| | THEREFORE / BUT / AND THEN | | |
| | THEREFORE / BUT / AND THEN | | |

### 3.3 Connector Ratio Calculation

```
RATIO_FORMULA:
  total_beats = COUNT(all beat transitions)
  causal_beats = COUNT(THEREFORE + BUT transitions)
  sequential_beats = COUNT(AND THEN transitions)

  causal_ratio = causal_beats / total_beats × 100

  SOUTH PARK TARGET: 100% THEREFORE/BUT
  ACCEPTABLE: 85%+ THEREFORE/BUT
  PROBLEMATIC: 70-84% THEREFORE/BUT
  FAILURE: Below 70% THEREFORE/BUT
```

**Draft Calculation:**
- Total transitions: _____
- THEREFORE: _____
- BUT: _____
- AND THEN: _____
- **Causal Ratio:** _____%

### 3.4 AND THEN Elimination Exercise

For each AND THEN transition, rewrite to create causality:

| Original AND THEN | Rewritten as THEREFORE or BUT |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| | |
| | |

## 4. Satirical Position Analysis

### 4.1 Position Mapping

Identify the positions/sides being satirized:

| Position | Who Holds It? | What's True About It? | What's Ridiculous About It? |
|----------|---------------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| Position A | | | |
| Position B | | | |
| Position C | | | |

**SOUTH PARK PRINCIPLE:** No position should be spared. If only one side is mocked, it's propaganda, not satire.

### 4.2 Extreme Position Stress Test

```
STRESS_TEST:
  Take each position to its logical extreme.

  FOR each position:
    1. State the position's core belief
    2. Extend it to absurd conclusion
    3. Show consequences of that extreme
    4. Does the draft do this?

  EXAMPLE:
    Position: "Privacy is important"
    Extreme: Character lives in total isolation to preserve privacy
    Consequence: Complete disconnection from human life
    Satirical Point: Privacy fetishization is its own prison
```

**Draft Analysis:**

| Position | Logical Extreme | Shown in Draft? |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| | | YES / NO |
| | | YES / NO |

### 4.3 The Both-Sides-Are-Wrong Test

```
BALANCE_TEST:
  Does the draft demonstrate that:
    - Position A taken to extreme is absurd? □
    - Position B taken to extreme is absurd? □
    - The "reasonable middle" is also mockable? □

  FULL SATIRE: All three boxes checked
  PARTIAL SATIRE: Two boxes checked
  ONE-SIDED: Only one box checked (not true satire)
```

---

## 5. The Lesson-Is-Never-The-Lesson Analysis

### 5.1 Stated vs. Emergent Theme

```
LESSON_DISTINCTION:
  STATED_LESSON = What characters SAY the moral is
  EMERGENT_LESSON = What the story SHOWS to be true

  SOUTH PARK PATTERN:
    Character states obvious lesson → Story contradicts or complicates it
    OR
    No character states lesson → Audience must derive it from events

  FAILURE PATTERN:
    Character states lesson → Story confirms it (preachy)
```

**Draft Analysis:**

| Who States a Lesson? | What Do They Say? | Does the Story Support or Undercut It? |
|----------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| | | SUPPORT / UNDERCUT / COMPLICATE |

### 5.2 Mouthpiece Detection

```
MOUTHPIECE_TEST:
  Is there a character who always speaks authorial truth?

  IF YES: That character is a mouthpiece (problem)
    - Either: Give them a blind spot to satirize
    - Or: Have events prove them wrong
    - Or: Remove their moral authority

  IF NO: Good — no character is "correct"
```

## 6. Comedy License Analysis

### 6.1 Extreme Content Inventory

List all potentially offensive or extreme content:

| Content | Type | Is It Funny? | Does It Serve Theme? |
|---------|------|--------------|---------------------|
| | Violence / Taboo / Offense | YES / NO | YES / NO |
| | Violence / Taboo / Offense | YES / NO | YES / NO |

### 6.2 Comedy License Test

```
LICENSE_TEST:
  FOR each extreme content element:
    1. Is it funny? (Comedy earns the license)
    2. Does it serve the theme? (Purpose earns the license)
    3. Does it punch up or down? (Punching down revokes license)

  IF funny AND thematic AND punches up/across: LICENSED
  IF NOT funny OR NOT thematic OR punches down: UNLICENSED

  UNLICENSED extreme content should be cut or reworked.
```

### 6.3 Sacred Cow Audit

What does the draft refuse to satirize? Why?

| Protected Element | Why Protected? | Should It Be Satirized? |
|-------------------|----------------|------------------------|
| | | |

**SOUTH PARK PRINCIPLE:** Nothing is sacred. If you're protecting something, examine why.

---

## 7. Speed/Clarity Philosophy

### 7.1 The 6-Day Test

> South Park episodes are written, animated, and aired in 6 days. This constraint forces clarity.

```
6-DAY_PHILOSOPHY:
  - No time for complexity that doesn't serve the point
  - Theme must be clear enough to execute fast
  - Every scene must be necessary
  - Cut anything you're "not sure about"
```

### 7.2 Clarity Stress Test

Answer these questions in 10 seconds or less:

1. What is this draft ABOUT? _____________
2. What does the protagonist WANT? _____________
3. What PREVENTS them from getting it? _____________
4. What is the WORST CASE if they fail? _____________

**IF you can't answer quickly:** The draft lacks clarity.

### 7.3 The "Not Sure" Cut List

List everything you're "not sure" about:

| Element | Why Unsure? | Decision: CLARIFY or CUT |
|---------|-------------|--------------------------|
| | | |
| | | |

**SOUTH PARK RULE:** When in doubt, cut it out.

## 10. Protocol-Specific Revision Prompts

Based on diagnostic results, address the following:

### If Thematic Clarity Weak:
- Write your theme in one sentence. Tape it to your monitor.
- For each scene, write "This advances the theme because..."
- Cut any scene that can't complete that sentence.

### If Causal Chain Broken:
- Rewrite all transitions with explicit THEREFORE or BUT
- For each AND THEN: What consequence could create causality?
- Work backward from climax: What HAD to happen?

### If Satire One-Sided:
- Identify which position you're protecting
- Push that position to its absurd extreme
- Show what's ridiculous about "your side" too

### If Lesson Too Clear:
- Find the character who states the moral
- Give them a blind spot or have events prove them wrong
- Let the audience figure it out

### If Comedy License Weak:
- For extreme content that isn't funny: Make it funnier or cut it
- For content that doesn't serve theme: Cut it
- For content that punches down: Redirect the target

### If Clarity Insufficient:
- Pretend you have to execute this in 6 days
- What would you cut?
- What would you simplify?

## 11. Application Notes for *Open View*

**Surveillance State as Satirical Target:** The smart home/surveillance premise invites satirizing BOTH privacy advocates AND security advocates. Neither should be "right."

**Family Dynamics as Position Holders:** Each family member could represent a different position on the surveillance question — and each position should be mockable.

**Technology as Extreme Extension:** The smart home can push any position to absurd extreme. Want privacy? Here's what total privacy looks like. Want security? Here's what total surveillance looks like.

**The Clone Question:** If Emma/Beth are clones, what position does that literalize? Identity? Privacy? Ownership of self? Push it to its logical extreme.

---

## Quick Reference Card

### The Parker Rule
```
THEREFORE or BUT — never AND THEN
```

### Thematic Test
```
"What is this ABOUT?" → One sentence answer required
Every scene must advance this or be cut
```

### Satirical Balance
```
Position A → Extreme → Absurd
Position B → Extreme → Absurd
Middle Ground → Also mockable
```

### Lesson Architecture
```
STATED lesson ≠ REAL lesson
No character should be "right"
Audience derives the point
```

### Comedy License
```
Extreme content requires:
  ✓ Be funny
  ✓ Serve the theme
  ✓ Punch up/across
```

### 6-Day Clarity
```
IF unclear: CUT
IF unsure: CUT
IF doesn't serve theme: CUT
```
