# Stanley Kubrick's narratological philosophy: primary sources and extractable principles

Stanley Kubrick believed films should function as **six to eight "non-submersible units"**—self-contained sequences that force audiences to draw their own connections rather than following continuous cause-and-effect narrative. This theory, documented in his conversations with collaborator Brian Aldiss, represents the core of a sophisticated storytelling philosophy that prioritized visual and emotional impact over verbal explanation, subconscious engagement over intellectual comprehension, and productive ambiguity over resolution. Across five major adaptations spanning three decades, Kubrick consistently applied these principles, transforming source material through systematic rules that can be formalized into extractable algorithms.

## The non-submersible units theory: Kubrick's structural foundation

The term "non-submersible units" comes from Brian Aldiss, author of "Supertoys Last All Summer Long," who collaborated with Kubrick on the A.I. project for years. In the documentary *Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures* (2001), Aldiss recounted their conversations about narrative structure:

> "I was always keen on the idea of narrative. My books always have a narrative. That is to say, cause and effect. That's what I like. But Stanley was less interested in that and he said to me 'now forget about the narrative'. He said **'what you need to make a movie is six non-submersible units'**. That was the phrase he used: 'non-submersible units'. And he said when we've got those we're away."

A Channel 4 documentary further documented this exchange: Kubrick told Aldiss, "All you need is six non-submersible units. Forget about the connections for the moment. You just get six really good non-submersible units." For A.I., they found two such units before Kubrick became excited: "Now be a genius, Brian, and do the next one." They never found the remaining four, though Kubrick knew roughly they would involve elemental forces—ice, water, fire.

The concept refers to sequences so robust they can stand independently—each with its own beginning, middle, and end—while audiences draw thematic connections between them. This deliberately rejects what Kubrick called "the three-act play model" that had "shackled" cinema since the talkies.

## Primary source statements on narrative philosophy

### Rejecting three-act structure and verbal storytelling

Kubrick's most extensive articulation of his philosophy appears in his **1969 interview with Joseph Gelmis** (published in *The Film Director as Superstar*):

> "The problem with movies is that since the talkies the film industry has historically been conservative and word-oriented. **The three-act play has been the model. It's time to abandon the conventional view of the movie as an extension of the three-act play.** Too many people over thirty are still word-oriented rather than picture-oriented."

> "Film is NOT theater—and until that basic lesson is learned I'm afraid we're going to be shackled to the past and miss some of the greatest potentialities of the medium."

In his **Michel Ciment interviews** (1972-1982, approved by Kubrick for publication), he elaborated on visual primacy:

> "In a film, however, I think **the images, the music, the editing and the emotions of the actors are the principal tools** you have to work with. Language is important but I would put it after those elements. It should even be possible to do a film which isn't gimmicky without using any dialogue at all."

> "As far as I'm concerned, **the most memorable scenes in the best films are those which are built predominantly of images and music.**"

### Subconscious engagement over intellectual processing

The **1968 Playboy interview** contains Kubrick's clearest statement on audience engagement:

> "2001 is a nonverbal experience; out of two hours and 19 minutes of film, there are only a little less than 40 minutes of dialog... **The very nature of the visual experience in 2001 is to give the viewer an instantaneous, visceral reaction that does not—and should not—require further amplification.**"

> "If the film stirs the emotions and penetrates the subconscious of the viewer, if it stimulates, however inchoately, his mythological and religious yearnings and impulses, then it has succeeded."

To Gelmis, Kubrick explained the mechanism: "I think that 2001, like music, succeeds in **short-circuiting the rigid surface cultural blocks that shackle our consciousness** to narrowly limited areas of experience and is able to cut directly through to areas of emotional comprehension."

He offered a striking analogy: "An Alabama truck driver, whose views in every other respect would be extremely narrow, is able to listen to a Beatles record on the same level of appreciation and perception as a young Cambridge intellectual, because their emotions and subconscious are far more similar than their intellects. **The common bond is their subconscious emotional reaction.**"

### Productive ambiguity as artistic necessity

Kubrick's most famous statement on ambiguity appeared in the Playboy interview:

> "How much would we appreciate La Gioconda today if Leonardo had written at the bottom of the canvas: 'This lady is smiling slightly because she has rotten teeth'—or 'because she's hiding a secret from her lover'? **It would shut off the viewer's appreciation and shackle him to a 'reality' other than his own.** I don't want that to happen to 2001."

To Gelmis, he elaborated: "No, I didn't have to try for ambiguity; it was inevitable. And I think in a film like 2001, where each viewer brings his own emotions and perceptions to bear on the subject matter, **a certain degree of ambiguity is valuable, because it allows the audience to 'fill in' the visual experience themselves.**"

In a separate interview (cited in Vincent LoBrutto's biography), Kubrick connected this to dreams: "If you accept the idea that one views a film in a state of 'daydream,' then this symbolic dreamlike content becomes a powerful factor in influencing your feelings about the film. Since your dreams can take you into areas which can never be a part of your conscious mind, **I think a work of art can 'operate' on you in much the same way as a dream does.**"

### The mystery principle

During the Barry Lyndon interviews (1975), Kubrick made his most direct statement about cinematic mystery: "**The most important parts of a film are the mysterious parts—beyond the reach of reason and language.**"

## Adaptation analysis: 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)

### Source transformation

Arthur C. Clarke's 1951 short story "The Sentinel" provided only the basic concept—an alien artifact discovered on the Moon serving as a "cosmic burglar alarm." Clarke himself acknowledged: "I am continually annoyed by careless references to 'The Sentinel' as 'the story on which 2001 is based'; **it bears about as much relation to the movie as an acorn to the resultant full-grown oak.**"

The novel, developed concurrently with the film, differs substantially. In Gelmis's interview, Kubrick explained the fundamental divergence: "**The novel, for example, attempts to explain things much more explicitly than the film does, which is inevitable in a verbal medium.** [The movie], on the other hand, is basically a visual, nonverbal experience."

**Key removals from novel/treatment:**
- A **10-minute documentary prologue** with scientists discussing extraterrestrial life (cut after MGM screening)
- **Voice-over narration** throughout, explaining ape intelligence, geological conditions, spacecraft operations
- **Explicit monolith explanations**—the teaching/testing device functionality visible in Clarke's prose
- **The Star Child's actions**—detonating an orbiting nuclear warhead to bring peace
- HAL's malfunction cause—the novel explicitly describes his conflict between orders to lie and programming for truthfulness

Kubrick explained his decision on the monolith: "I eventually decided that **to depict the monolith in such an explicit manner would be to run the risk of making it appear no more than an advanced television teaching machine.** You can get away with something so literal in print, but I felt that we could create a far more powerful and magical effect by representing it as we did in the film."

### Non-submersible units structure demonstrated

2001 exemplifies the theory through its distinct segments:

1. **Dawn of Man**—prehistoric ape-ancestors discover tools/weapons
2. **TMA-1 Discovery**—Dr. Floyd's lunar investigation
3. **Journey to Jupiter**—establishing the Discovery mission
4. **HAL 9000 Crisis**—the computer's breakdown and murders
5. **Star Gate Sequence**—Bowman's psychedelic journey
6. **Hotel Room/Rebirth**—aging, death, transformation

Each functions nearly as a standalone short film. No conventional character throughlines connect them—different characters populate each major section. The audience must draw thematic connections between units rather than following continuous narrative causation.

## Adaptation analysis: A Clockwork Orange (1971)

### The 21st chapter controversy

Anthony Burgess's novel contained 21 chapters in its British edition; the American edition omitted chapter 21, which depicted Alex's maturation and renunciation of violence. Kubrick used the American edition.

In Michel Ciment's interview, Kubrick stated his position clearly:

> "There are two different versions of the novel. One has an extra chapter... This extra chapter depicts the rehabilitation of Alex. But it is, as far as I am concerned, **unconvincing and inconsistent with the style and intent of the book**. I wouldn't be surprised to learn that the publisher had somehow prevailed upon Burgess to tack on the extra chapter against his better judgment, so the book would end on a more positive note. **I certainly never gave any serious consideration to using it.**"

Remarkably, the Anthony Burgess Foundation has documented that Burgess himself was ambivalent. His 1961 manuscript contains a handwritten note at the foot of Chapter 20: "Should we end here? An optional 'epilogue' follows." In his own 1966 film script (before Kubrick's involvement), **Burgess also omitted the 21st chapter**.

### Violence, sympathy, and the subconscious

Kubrick's justification for depicting Alex's brutality reveals his understanding of moral structure:

> "It was absolutely necessary to give weight to Alex's brutality, otherwise I think there would be moral confusion with respect to what the government does to him. If he were a lesser villain, then one could say: 'Oh, yes, of course, he should not be given this psychological conditioning; it's all too horrible and he really wasn't that bad after all.' On the other hand, **when you have shown him committing such atrocious acts, and you still realise the immense evil on the part of the government in turning him into something less than human** in order to make him good, then I think the essential moral idea of the book is clear."

On audience identification with a monster, Kubrick offered a psychological explanation:

> "I think that it's probably because **we can identify with Alex on the unconscious level. The psychiatrists tell us the unconscious has no conscience**—and perhaps in our unconscious we are all potential Alexes. It may be that only as a result of morality, the law and sometimes our own innate character that we do not become like him."

### Adaptation as code-breaking

Kubrick articulated his adaptation philosophy most clearly regarding this film:

> "Writing a screenplay is a very different thing than writing a novel or an original story. A good story is a kind of a miracle... On the other hand, writing the screenplay of the book is much more of a **logical process—something between writing and breaking a code**. It does not require the inspiration or the invention of the novelist."

> "**I tried to find something like a cinematic equivalent of Burgess's literary style**, and Alex's highly subjective view of things. But the style of any film has to do more with intuition than with analysis."

The famous "Singin' in the Rain" sequence—not in the novel—emerged from this process. After struggling for days with a "too conventional" home invasion scene, Kubrick asked Malcolm McDowell: "Can you dance?" McDowell improvised the song because it was "the only song I sort of knew half the lyrics to" and "the most euphoric song in film history." Kubrick paid **$10,000** for the rights immediately. The song then became the narrative device for recognition later in the film—a cinematic solution impossible in prose.

## Adaptation analysis: Barry Lyndon (1975)

### The narrator transformation

Kubrick made perhaps his most significant structural change by transforming Thackeray's unreliable first-person narrator into an ironic omniscient third-person voice (Michael Hordern). He explained why this was necessary:

> "I believe Thackeray used Redmond Barry to tell his own story in a deliberately distorted way because it made it more interesting. Instead of the omniscient author, Thackeray used the imperfect observer, or perhaps it would be more accurate to say **the dishonest observer**, thus allowing the reader to judge for himself, with little difficulty, the probable truth in Redmond Barry's view of his life."

> "This technique worked extremely well in the novel but, of course, **in a film you have objective reality in front of you all of the time**, so the effect of Thackeray's first-person story-teller could not be repeated on the screen. **It might have worked as comedy by the juxtaposition of Barry's version of the truth with the reality on the screen, but I don't think that Barry Lyndon should have been done as a comedy.**"

### Anticipation over surprise

Kubrick articulated a crucial narrative principle through Barry Lyndon:

> "*Barry Lyndon* is a story which does not depend upon surprise. **What is important is not *what* is going to happen, but *how* it will happen.** I think Thackeray trades off the advantage of surprise to gain a greater sense of inevitability and a better integration of what might otherwise seem melodramatic or contrived."

He provided a specific example: "Another place in the story where I think this technique works particularly well is where we are told that Barry's young son, Bryan, is going to die at the same time we watch the two of them playing happily together... Being told in advance of the impending disaster gives away surprise **but creates suspense.**"

### Voice-over as narrative economy

On the necessity of narration (contradicting the common screenwriting adage against it):

> "There is too much story to tell. A voice-over spares you the cumbersome business of telling the necessary facts of the story through expositional dialogue scenes which can become very tiresome and frequently unconvincing: 'Curse the blasted storm that's wrecked our blessed ship!' **Voice-over, on the other hand, is a perfectly legitimate and economical way of conveying story information which does not need dramatic weight** and which would otherwise be too bulky to dramatize."

### The silent film principle

Kubrick expressed admiration for silent cinema's narrative efficiency:

> "I think that **silent films got a lot more things right than talkies**... I should include the best TV commercials along with silent films, as another example of how you might better tell a film story. In thirty seconds, characters are introduced, and sometimes a surprisingly involved situation is set up and resolved."

> "I think that the scope and flexibility of movie stories would be greatly enhanced by borrowing something from the structure of silent movies where points that didn't require dialog could be presented by a shot and a title card... **This economy of statement gives silent movies a much greater narrative scope and flexibility than we have today.**"

## Adaptation analysis: The Shining (1980)

### Psychological preparation vs. gradual corruption

Kubrick's most substantial character transformation involved Jack Torrance. While Stephen King wrote a sympathetic figure gradually corrupted by supernatural forces, Kubrick's Jack arrives psychologically primed for violence:

> "Jack comes to the hotel **psychologically prepared to do its murderous bidding**. He doesn't have very much further to go for his anger and frustration to become completely uncontrollable. He is bitter about his failure as a writer. He is married to a woman for whom he has only contempt. He hates his son. In the hotel, at the mercy of its powerful evil, he is quickly ready to fulfill his dark role."

### Ambiguity as narrative force

Kubrick explained his approach to the supernatural/psychological divide:

> "I think The Shining uses a similar kind of psychological misdirection to forestall the realization that the supernatural events are actually happening... **For the purposes of telling the story, my view is that the paranormal is genuine. Jack's mental state serves only to prepare him for the murder, and to temporarily mislead the audience.**"

On simplifying King's psychological backstory, Kubrick told John Hofsess (Soho News, 1980): "I don't think the audience is likely to miss the many and self-consciously 'heavy' pages King devotes to things like Jack's father's drinking problem or Wendy's mother. To me, all that is quite irrelevant. There's the case of putting in too many psychological clues of trying to explain why Jack is the way he is, which is not really important... **the main force of the story lies in its ambiguity.**"

### Ending transformation

Kubrick rejected King's boiler explosion conclusion: "To be honest, **the end of the book seemed a bit hackneyed to me and not very interesting**. I wanted an ending which the audience could not anticipate. In the film, they think Hallorann is going to save Wendy and Danny. When he is killed they fear the worst."

### Stephen King's documented objections (for contrast)

King has been consistently critical of the adaptation:

- On Nicholson's casting: "Jack Nicholson was all wrong for the part... **The character has no arc in that movie. Absolutely no arc at all. When we first see him, he's crazy as a shit house rat.** All he does is get crazier. In the book, he's a guy who's struggling with his sanity and finally loses it. To me, that's a tragedy. In the movie, there's no tragedy because there's no real change."

- On Wendy: "Shelley Duvall's Wendy is really one of the most misogynistic characters ever put on film. She's basically just there to scream and be stupid, and that's not the woman that I wrote about."

- On emotional temperature: "With Kubrick's The Shining I felt that it was very cold, very, 'We're looking at these people, but they're like ants in an anthill, aren't they doing interesting things, these little insects.'"

- His summary: "I think 'The Shining' is a beautiful film and it looks terrific and as I've said before, it's like **a great big beautiful Cadillac with no engine inside it.**"

Kubrick's response to Wendy criticism, however, reveals deliberate character design: "**The novel pictures her as a much more self-reliant and attractive woman, but these qualities make you wonder why she has put up with Jack for so long.** Shelley seemed to be exactly the kind of woman that would marry Jack and be stuck with him."

## Adaptation analysis: Eyes Wide Shut (1999)

### A decades-long obsession

Kubrick first encountered Arthur Schnitzler's *Traumnovelle* (Dream Story) in the 1950s, possibly through his second wife Ruth Sobotka, a Viennese Jew. He purchased the film rights after completing *Spartacus* in 1960. The project gestated for nearly **40 years**.

In a 1960 interview with Robert Emmett Ginna (published posthumously in 1999), Kubrick articulated his fascination:

> "It's difficult to find any writer who understood the human soul more truly and who had a more profound insight into the way people think, act, and really are, and who also had a somewhat all-seeing point of view—sympathetic, if somewhat cynical."

> "I think he's one of the most underrated writers of the 20th century; probably because he didn't deal with things that are obviously full of social significance, he has been ignored."

When screenwriter Frederic Raphael suggested the material was dated, Kubrick's response was telling:
- **RAPHAEL:** "Things have changed a lot between men and women since Schnitzler's time."
- **KUBRICK:** "Have they? I don't think they have."
- **RAPHAEL:** (After thought) "Neither do I."

### Reaching feelings, not brains

In the same 1960 Ginna interview, Kubrick articulated his core narrative philosophy:

> "**The most potent way to move an audience is to reach their feelings and not their brains.** Of course, it's a much more dangerous way to write, because if the audience fails to discover what you mean, they're left quite disturbed."

### Major transformation: setting and identity

The most obvious change—Vienna 1900s to New York City 1990s—stripped away the novella's specific cultural context (Habsburg Empire, anti-Semitic fraternities, Viennese Jewish identity, dueling culture) while preserving the psychological dynamics. The addition of Christmas imagery created new symbolic layers around family, consumerism, and hypocrisy.

Kubrick added an entirely new character—Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack)—who has no equivalent in Schnitzler. Ziegler represents wealth, power, and elite society, providing "explanations" in the pool table scene that may or may not be truthful.

### Dream logic preservation

The title "Traumnovelle" means "Dream Novella." Kubrick preserved this quality through artificial sets (entire New York streets rebuilt at Pinewood Studios), rear projection for walking scenes, repetition of dialogue and phrases, pervasive Christmas lights and red motifs, and spatial disorientation through wide-angle lenses.

Tom Cruise described Kubrick's approach: "When you look at *Eyes Wide Shut*, there's the sense of, 'Is this a dream or is this a nightmare?' and how do you handle the aspects of the story in such a way that you're not resorting to the usual visual techniques to say, 'This is nightmare.'"

### The ending transformation

Schnitzler's ending leaves the couple lying in bed "as if there were a sword between us...lying here side by side like mortal enemies," drifting into "dreamless sleep" as their daughter's laughter wakes them. Resolution is ambiguous.

Kubrick's ending—set in FAO Schwarz, featuring Alice's final word "Fuck" (added entirely by Kubrick) and her rejection of "forever" ("Let's not use that word. It frightens me")—represents a shift from literary ambiguity to what Cruise called Kubrick's intention: "Stanley said, 'This is a happy ending.'" The practical/physical replaces the metaphysical.

## Kubrick's narratological algorithms: extractable principles

Based on primary source statements and consistent adaptation practices across five films, Kubrick's approach can be formalized into the following principles:

### Algorithm 1: The non-submersible units structure

```
FUNCTION structure_narrative(source_material):
    IDENTIFY 6-8 high-impact sequences that can stand independently
    ENSURE each unit has:
        - Its own beginning, middle, end
        - Emotional/thematic completeness
        - Maximum visual/musical impact
    REMOVE connective tissue that explains causation
    FORCE audience to draw connections between units
    REJECT three-act play model
    RETURN sequence of independent units
```

**Primary source:** "All you need is six non-submersible units. Forget about the connections for the moment." (Kubrick to Brian Aldiss, *Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures*)

### Algorithm 2: The subconscious engagement principle

```
FUNCTION engage_audience(scene):
    PRIORITIZE:
        1. Images
        2. Music
        3. Editing
        4. Actor emotions
        5. Language (last)
    TARGET subconscious, not conscious mind
    BYPASS "rigid surface cultural blocks"
    OPERATE like music or dreams
    AVOID intellectual verbalization
    IF explanation_required:
        SHOW, don't tell
        OR use ironic narration
    RETURN visceral emotional response
```

**Primary source:** "The most potent way to move an audience is to reach their feelings and not their brains." (Kubrick to Robert Emmett Ginna, 1960)

### Algorithm 3: The productive ambiguity rule

```
FUNCTION preserve_ambiguity(narrative_element):
    NEVER explain meaning explicitly
    REMOVE "pseudo-psychological clues"
    ALLOW multiple valid interpretations
    IF audience_might_be_confused:
        ACCEPT as feature, not bug
        "Ambiguity allows audience to 'fill in' visual experience"
    TRUST audience subconscious over intellect
    RETURN mystery
```

**Primary source:** "The most important parts of a film are the mysterious parts—beyond the reach of reason and language." (Kubrick, Barry Lyndon interview, 1975)

### Algorithm 4: The adaptation code-breaking process

```
FUNCTION adapt_source_material(novel):
    READ for first time (preserve first impressions)
    EXTRACT essential plot
    IDENTIFY weak sections requiring reinvention
    FIND cinematic equivalents (not literal translations)
    REMOVE:
        - Excessive backstory
        - Psychological explanations
        - Elements requiring "gimmicky" visualization
    TRANSFORM narrative voice if necessary:
        IF unreliable_narrator AND medium_shows_objective_reality:
            CONVERT to ironic omniscient
    RETAIN "spirit of the novel"
    RETURN screenplay as "code-breaking" not invention
```

**Primary source:** "Writing the screenplay of the book is much more of a logical process—something between writing and breaking a code." (Kubrick to Michel Ciment)

### Algorithm 5: The anticipation-over-surprise principle

```
FUNCTION structure_revelation(plot_event):
    CONSIDER: What matters is not WHAT happens but HOW
    IF event is inevitable or fated:
        REVEAL outcome in advance
        CREATE suspense through anticipation
        AVOID surprise/melodrama
    TRADE surprise for "greater sense of inevitability"
    USE narrator/intertitles to announce fate
    RETURN tragic weight without contrivance
```

**Primary source:** "Barry Lyndon is a story which does not depend upon surprise. What is important is not *what* is going to happen, but *how* it will happen." (Kubrick to Michel Ciment)

### Algorithm 6: The character opacity rule

```
FUNCTION develop_character(character):
    SHOW behavior, not explain psychology
    REMOVE explanatory backstory
    IF character_has_complex_inner_life:
        EXTERNALIZE through action/image
        AVOID introspective dialogue ("often very dull")
    ALLOW mystery around motivation
    ACCEPT that "in a film you have objective reality"
    RETURN ambiguous, watchable behavior
```

**Primary source:** "There's the case of putting in too many psychological clues of trying to explain why Jack is the way he is, which is not really important... the main force of the story lies in its ambiguity." (Kubrick to John Hofsess, 1980)

### Algorithm 7: The silent film efficiency principle

```
FUNCTION convey_information(story_point):
    IF point doesn't require dialogue:
        USE image + title card (or equivalent)
    STUDY silent films and TV commercials
    ACHIEVE "economy of statement"
    GAIN "greater narrative scope and flexibility"
    USE voice-over for:
        - Bulk information without dramatic weight
        - Ironic counterpoint to visual action
    NEVER use dialogue to "spell out what characters are thinking"
    RETURN visual storytelling
```

**Primary source:** "I think that silent films got a lot more things right than talkies." (Kubrick to Michel Ciment)

### Algorithm 8: The technical-serves-narrative rule

```
FUNCTION choose_technique(narrative_goal):
    START with WHAT must be achieved
    ONLY THEN determine HOW to film it
    IF technique draws attention to itself:
        RECONSIDER (unless serving specific purpose)
    INNOVATE only when existing tools insufficient:
        e.g., NASA lens for Barry Lyndon candlelight
        e.g., Steadicam for Shining immersion
    GOAL: "Make you believe what you see"
    RETURN technique invisible in service of story
```

**Primary source:** "The first thing to do is to rehearse the scene until something happens that is worth putting on film—only then should you worry about HOW to film it. The WHAT must always precede the HOW." (Kubrick to Michel Ciment)

## Conclusion: the Kubrickian method formalized

Kubrick's consistent adaptation philosophy across four decades reveals a filmmaker who treated narrative not as storytelling but as **emotional architecture**. His non-submersible units theory rejects the teleological momentum of conventional drama—where each scene causes the next—in favor of juxtaposed sequences that resonate thematically while forcing active audience participation.

The extractable principles share a common foundation: **trust the audience's subconscious more than their intellect**. Remove explanations. Preserve mystery. Let images and music carry meaning that words would diminish. Structure narrative as music structures emotion—through rhythm, repetition, and resonance rather than logical argument.

What distinguishes Kubrick's adaptations is not what he added but **what he systematically removed**: Clarke's explanations, Burgess's redemptive ending, Thackeray's unreliable narrator, King's psychological backstory, Schnitzler's period specificity. Each removal served the same goal—clearing space for the audience to project their own consciousness onto the screen, to "fill in" meaning rather than receive it.

His final word on the matter, from the Gelmis interview, serves as summary: "Film thus becomes a subjective experience which hits the viewer at an inner level of consciousness, just as music does, or painting." The algorithms above are attempts to codify how Kubrick achieved that musical quality—but as he himself noted, "the style of any film has to do more with intuition than with analysis."
