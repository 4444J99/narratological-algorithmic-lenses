BLACK SCREEN...

...a small indecipherable, yet aggressive LOGO hovers in the bottom corner of the screen at half opacity. In the opposite right corner, a TIMESTAMP counts down toward ZERO.

...the SINGLE SCREEN splits into FOUR QUADRANTS: 1L (top left), 1R (top right), 2L (bottom left), 2R (bottom right). 

A dull, throbbing STATIC feedback fills each QUADRANT. 

...1L flickers alive, a high definition image fills the screen - the other QUADRANTS soon follow suite one at a time.

.1L - EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - EVENING

STREET GUTTER

Torrential downpour BEATS the sharp-edged metal and glass homes of a suburban street. Some homes have their shutters closed to fight the storm, others do not have the same level of fear. 

A WAVE of WATER runs with steady force down the STREET GUTTER, partially obstructing our view.

Sleek matte CARS ZIP away from the GUTTER CAM in quick intervals, floating just above the flooded street. 

One car pulls into a driveway opposite the GUTTER CAM. 

The CAR DESCENDS onto the ground.

An UMBRELLA appears from the CAR.

High-heeled feet of a working woman in her early 40s, LI, hop out of the vehicle’s backseat. She’s wearing a long overcoat.

The WIND almost whips her off feet, she fights her way out of frame and toward her home. 

.1L - EXT. HOME - CONTINUOUS

FRONT DOOR

Li approaches the front door searching her pocketbook and then pockets, trying to keep her umbrella from BLOWING her away.

Her fishbowl face right up against the door, jittery.

The DOOR PROMPTS Li to be still, and Li abides.

The DOOR scans Li’s retina, and Li is permitted entrance into her home.

The LAST FEW FRAMES of Li entering the house are looped on repeat.

As Li’s car pulled into the driveway, 2R moves from static to high definition life:

.2R - INT. MASTER BATHROOM - EVENING

CEILING AIR CONDITION DUCT CAM

The bathroom LIGHT flickers on igniting with a CLINICAL yellow the makings of a properly messy his-and-her style bathroom, each opposite end of the opposing sinks littered with products for him and for her. Stuff to keep skin taut and tight, hairlines steady, and hearts healthy.

A man who looks twenty but is in his late 40’s, FRE, enters the frame walking toward his extreme side of the bathroom sink, leaving the other side barren. He is in his pajama pants, and a bit out of optimal shape.

He pauses in front of his sink and looks to the mirror, staring at himself for a moment.

He walks over to the toilet, slipping his mobile device from a pocket, slides down his pants and takes a seat at the bowl. 

A smaller frame appears in Fre’s QUADRANT displaying what he views on his mobile device: he messages another woman or two on a social media website, he then switches to porn.

PORN AUDIO overthrows all other CAM AUDIO INPUTS. 

Fre fast-forwards the video causing the PORN AUDIO to JITTER and STUTTER.

He reaches down to masturbate.

CENSORED.

Fre’s BLURRED FORM melts. Masturbating, moving, and thriving under a dull blanket of censorship. 

A few frames are looped. Shorter in length than Li’s loop, the two frames PULSE RHYTHMICALLY.

As Fre’ sat at the toilet, 1R CUTS TO LIFE:

.1R - INT. DAUGHTER’S BEDROOM - EVENING

LAPTOP SELFIE CAM

SUS, a 17 year old girl multiplied infinitely by her placement in a bedroom occupied with mirrors, dons her ballet practice uniform. Her hair is messier than the oft pinned back hair of a performer. She faces away from her laptop, still for a few moments - eyes locked with herself. In each ear, a firmly placed EARBUD.

She practices multiple takes on the pirouette, counting aloud every rotation.  

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight --

She falters, she starts again.

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve --

She falter, she stares into her soul, she starts again.

SUS successfully reaches fifteen consecutive pirouettes.

She hops up high in a quick celebration, her face bright and lofty for the way up...

Before quickly recomposing herself, sullen and withdrawn on the landing. 

Without taking her EARBUDS out, dancing to non-classical music we can not hear, starts to get naked.

CENSORED.

Her BLURRED FORM bends down to take off her stockings, cuts back to erect, bends down, on LOOP. She joins the other three frames, now all at different lengths. The polyrhythms fight for attention.

During Sus’ final pirouette sequence, 2L, the final quadrant’s static segues into high definition footage with the drop of a cellphone:

.2L - INT. SON’S BEDROOM - EVENING

MOBILE PHONE CAM

FALLS to the ground, time and space BLURRED and unrecognizable for a few moments. 

A mirrored wall covered in images of loosely clad busty females.

Fog fills the LENS.

A shirtless teenage boy, ROK, DROPS into FRAME stretching. 

He reaches for the phone, then positions it under himself more perfectly. 

He looks directly into the frame, checking to see if the frame is framed properly.

He ignores the CAMERA, and solidifies his pose.

Rok switches between multiple yoga poses. Parts of his BODY are left out of FRAME. 

Rok suddenly drops to his hands and knees.

Rok’s body contorts, he grips his stomach and runs out of FRAME and the sounds of RETCHING play O.S.

Each time Rok vomits, the next one sounds worse than before. He vomits three times.

Rok enters the frame and resumes position, exits, returning and leaving the FRAME on LOOP.

Each QUADRANT beats to its own rhythm now. The AUDIO from each QUADRANT creates atonal madness.

The length's of each clip shift, their endings and beginnings slowly line up, until ALL FOUR are in SYNC.

AUDIO FILTERS OUT. A MOMENT OF SILENCE, before --

A SIREN.

The FOUR QUADRANTS DISTORT...

Then MORPH into one another becoming ONE WIDESCREEN IMAGE, each person overlaying one another, yet all one flattened image and moment, MOVING in and out of SYNC.

FADE OUT.

The LOGO and TIMECODE linger unwavering in their respective corners, never for once leaving the screen for the duration of the film.

TIMECODE: -08:37:98

CUT TO:

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - LATER

Li and Fre sit propped and oblivious on opposite ends of their king size bed. The screens on their mobile phones are mirrored in tiny boxes on the screen for the viewers to see.

Fre’s actions are constant and fractured, viewing similar content to just before when he was in the bathroom alone. 

Li views nothing but her home-screen, she mimes the usage of her mobile device.

Li’s static screen wisps closed.

She shifts her body language to gain Fre’s attention.

Fre does not notice. 

Li shifts around, faux uncomfortable, a few more times - but nothing gets Fre’s attention. 

Fre laughs at a PORN BLOOPER GIF.

Li awaits a moment that will not come, so she forces the moment.

LI
We are getting divorced.

Fre, still replaying the LOOPED PORN GIF, does not quite hear Li.  

Li JUMPS over the bed, she SLAPS Fre’s mobile phone from his hand. She stands over him.

LI (CONT’D)
I am leaving you.  

Fre slides around LI and off the king size bed, he retrieves his discarded device.

He stands behind her now, facing away from her.

FRE
We are getting divorced. You are leaving me. I heard you. No need to act like a wild animal. 

LI
We will tell Rok and Sus tomorrow?

Li retreats back to the other side of her bed. She crouches near the bed, without getting on, facing Fre’s backside, waiting for him to turn around.

FRE
We are getting divorced. You are leaving me. We will tell Rok and Sus tomorrow. Where do I sign?

Fre turns back around, pauses --

His phone drops to his side, and assumes his comfortable position from before.

LI
What about Lef?

FRE
You wanted him. You get to have him.

LI
That’s not how I remember the conversation happening. I seem to remember you saying you’d leave if we didn’t have another child.

FRE
And now I’m saying, I’m leaving regardless. I am going on an extended vacation. You might never see me again. If lucks on my side. Which, of course, never is.

Li rolls her eyes, gets into bed:

LI
“Everywhere you go, there you are.” Your mom was smart, you should’ve listened to her sometimes.

Fre rolls his eyes.

FRE
Except most other places I’ll be me there without you. Free at last.

Their rolling eyes lock from across the bed for the first time.

LI
Nothing close to free.

FRE
When it suits you she is smart when it doesn’t she’s a manipulative bitch?

LI
Are you asking?

FRE
I’m recalling.

A moment of silence and retreat.

LI
Good. I’m glad we agree.

FRE
At least we can agree on something still once in awhile.

Fre looks over to Li once again, he smirks.

Li returns a quick smile back to him. 

Li spins around on the bed, and burrows deeply under the covers.

LI
Can you turn out the light soon?

Fre pauses.

He’s annoyed. 

But after looking towards his wife, a wave of relief washes over him. 

He reaches over to his bedside lamp --

CUT TO:

EXT. HOME - NIGHT

Darkness engulfs the Home. Lights flicker in every room.

The light in the MASTER BEDROOM shuts off. 

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. HOME - MORNING

The pale shadow of the sun rises behind the house, its rays barely cuts through rain and fog. Lights flickering in every room at night continue to flicker in the morning, their light now muted by day.

CUT TO:

INT. SON'S BEDROOM - MORNING

AIR CONDITION CEILING VENT CAM

Rok halts out of bed. 

He grabs a glass of dark liquid from his bedside table and chokes it down. 

He places the glass back onto the bedside table, then drops to the ground.

Rok holds a steadfast plank on the floor directly below the CAM. DIGITALLY PROJECTED early morning sunshine throws large shadows across the floor. Rok records himself with his smartphone.

He descends and ascends into a tight military pushup with a slow double eight-count. The light ignites peaks and valleys across his back.

CUT TO:

INT. SON’S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Rok retches out of frame.

His head pops up into frame, and he spits into the sink below him. 

He turns on the faucet and brushes his teeth. 

He flexes his upper body muscles. Contracting his shoulders and back, pulling his head into his neck.

He pulls on the flesh of his under arm.

He slaps himself in the face.



CUT TO:

INT. DAUGHTER’S BEDROOM - MORNING

LAPTOP CAM

Sus stares directly into and beyond the LAPTOP CAM. Wide awake, motionless and emotionless - her face stone and empty.

OVERWHELMINGLY LOUD CLASSICAL music starts playing in the background.

Tears well in her eyes. 

She almost loses control of herself, and the day that awaits.

A tear rolls down her face.

After a long few moments, she comes to life, sitting up, legs crossed.

She reaches over to her bedside table for a bottled glass of water, and then drinks the whole glass with a few gulps.

She wipes the tears from her face and grits her teeth, biting her lower lip.

CUT TO:

INT. MASTER BATHROOM - MORNING

MIRROR LIGHTS SCONCE 

A lot goes into looking twenty years younger: Li and Fre perform their morning routine. 

Li applies a dark lotion around her eyes, the lotion shifts to her skin tone.

Fre applies lotion to his triceps and forearms. 

DISSOLVE TO:

Li squirts clear spray over her entire head, she runs a comb through her hair. It straightens and drys.

Fre applies a mousse to his head, his hair thickens and forms a tight geometric shape.

DISSOLVE TO:

Li and Fre brush their teeth.

Spit.

PING.

Fre peeks at his mobile then starts to trim his facial hair.

FRE
Wow. Da’s kids dead. Another shooting.

LI
Ha. The male?

Li, blushes her face.

FRE
Yeah, I - no, the female...when it hits so close to home...kind of scary.

Li stops applying blush to her face. 

She choses her words...

LI
He was always such an asshole. Remember Atlantis? Ugh.

FRE
Every guy you fucked is an asshole.

LI
What does that say about you?

Fre puts down his electric buzzer.

FRE
What does that say about _you_?

He spits into the sink. Then picks up a pair of tweezers.

LI
You think he’s an asshole too. You’ve said it a hundred times.

Li begins reapplying her blush.

FRE
I said it once. Maybe.

Fre plucks his brows.

LI
You could’ve said it never. Its all over your face anytime we’re around him.

She is applying lipstick.

FRE
I think he’s an asshole because he fucked you. You think he’s an asshole because you fucked him. 

Li’s hands drop to her side as she turns to Fre, she cocks her hips --

LI
I think...we can both agree...we all sometimes are...fucking assholes. 

A short silence breathes. They resume not existing together.

Fre quickly peeks over to her side of the bathroom, before his eyes move back to himself.

Fre, paused in all activities, staring towards Li: 

FRE
When are you going to tell them? You should get this over with. I’m going to Vegas, already have seen some cheap flights in bed last night. A few have went up in price since then. So the quicker we get the dates in order, the better.

Before she answers, he withdraws his gaze. 

Plucking another hair.

FRE (CONT’D)
That ingrown was huge.

LI
When are _we_ going to tell them?

FRE
You.

LI
We.

FRE
I did not know you spoke French.

Li laughs.

LI
That was a pity laugh. 
(imitating the laugh)
Ha.

Fre starts to laugh to himself, almost hyperventilating. 

He turns his body towards her, this time his hands are at his side.

With a finger raised and accusing he starts. 

FRE
You know what your problem is? 

His body retreats away from Li the louder he gets.

FRE (CONT’D)
You’re problem is that you’re an unfuckable cunt. Plain and simple. Un-fuckable-cunt.

He’s breathing heavy, and thinks he just brought the whole world crashing down.

Li doesn’t grant his outburst a reaction.

She giggles, and agrees:

LI
I am an unfuckable cunt. You are an unlovable slob. True. And what an awful combination that turned out to be for us. 

He stands their, arms folded, head bowed down and out.

FRE
I should add that to my dating profile.

LI
Before or after premature ejaculator?

His head raises with a sheepish grin.

FRE
Do you think I’m stupid enough to broadcast that? That’s a post fuck revelation, not a pre. 

LI
How else do you trick them?

FRE
How’d I trick you?

Li, applying eye liner, says:

LI
You used to be funny...Still are, sometimes.

FRE
Then?

LI
Then you got lazy.

FRE
And you got cold.

LI
I did. I did get cold.

Fre confused.

FRE
You knew what was happening and you didn’t try to course correct it?

LI
I don’t think I wanted to. 

PING.

Fre looks at his smartphone again.

FRE
I’m forwarding you the primary schools that Lef has gotten into. 

Li remains emotionless.

Fre exits the frame.

Li’s eyes sink into her skull, a wave of dread engulfs her.

INSECT DRONE FLASHES into FRAME before FLASHING OUT.

A BLACK BOX dropped almost out of sight.

CUT TO:

INT. HOME KITCHEN - MORNING

DRUG DISPENSER

Sus enters the frame, freezes into a statue, has her retina scanned.

PILLS whoosh down into a dispenser.

She grabs her handful and swallows them, chasing them with a large gulp of water from her glass water bottle.

DOORBELL RINGS.

Sus walks around the kitchen toward a metal convection oven, opens the oven, pulls out a plate.

ABOVE THE REFRIGERATOR CAM

Sus walks toward the kitchen table to join Li.

Li sits on glass stool at a long glass table, a small plate with a mass of food matter in the shape of a pie chart in front of them. Li is not touching her food.

Sus hurries to sit, then chows down.

Li, disturbed by Sus’ eating:

LI
(to SUS)
Is the appetite suppressant not working as effectively as before?

Sus takes another bite of her breakfast while holding eye contact.

Fre enters the kitchen and stops just out of frame.

DRUG DISPENSER

Fre is warned to remain still, his retina is scanned.

The sound of PILLS whooshing down a metal slide. 

He grabs a handful and swallows them dry.

Following the same pattern as Sus, grabs a plate of food from the oven, then -- 

ABOVE THE REFRIGERATOR CAM

Fre joins his family at the table.

CUT TO:

EXT. HOME - CONTINUOUS

The FRONT DOOR opens. Rok appears.

He hesitates, 

scratches his head,

then crouches down and picks up the BLACK BOX. It is heavier than he anticipated it being. 

He holds it then in one hand, spinning it like a basketball player.

CUT TO:

INT. HOME - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

ABOVE THE REFRIGERATOR CAM

Rok enters the kitchen, BLACK BOX in hand, he places it down on the table.

TIMECODE: -00:00:00

Rok leaves frame.

FRE
(to LI)
You sure got big pockets.

LI
It was my New Year’s resolution to spend less. You think I cracked this quick? I have some willpower, unlike you.

ROK’S BODY CAM

Rok, with a plate of food in hands, joins the table, taking a seat facing Sus and Fre:

ROK (O.S.)
Here it goes.

SUS
(making quick eye contact with Rok)
Was not me.

LI’S BODY CAM FACING ROK

ROK
(returning the eye contact)
Me neither.

FRE’S BODY CAM FACING LI

She looks up to Fre annoyed.

FRE (O.S.)
(to LI)
I know your methamphetamine-salts get you all so riled up at the crack of dawn, so I’ll ignore you and we can talk when you want to be reasonable. 

ABOVE THE REFRIGERATOR CAM

Sus pushed her plate away from her.

SUS
If you’re done bickering, the reminder for Lef’s filter changing pinged when I got into the kitchen.

Sus stands up, to leave the table...

LI
Do you need an invitation to change it?

SUS
I changed it last time.

LI
If you see something, do something - don’t pass the chore onto someone else.

SUS
He’s right. You _are_ so aggressive in the morning.

Sus, plate in hand, leaves the frame.

ROK
(to Li)
Maybe you should get balanced? I’ve been meaning to ask you to make an appointment for me, maybe you can do one for both of us?

LI
You all make me aggressive, not my medication.

ROK’S BODY CAM

Shifts between Li and Fre.

ROK (O.S.)
Who is picking me up after practice?

Fre, eyes on his food:

FRE
No one is picking anyone up. You know how to get home, don’t be lazy.

SUS (O.S.)
Impossible.

SUS BODY CAM

A fresh plate of food in hand, walks back toward the table. Rok’s eyes are on her. 

ROK
Watch yourself.

SUS (O.S.)
You already do all the watching of me for me.

ROK
Don’t flatter yourself.

Rok’s eyes move and up and down her body.

Sitting down at the table again:

SUS
I lost count of how many times I’ve caught you talking to my tits.

ABOVE THE REFRIGERATOR CAM

FRE
He’s a sixteen year old boy, he can’t help himself.

LI
(ignoring Fre and Sus)
I’ll be home early, so I could pick you both up from school.

FRE
Do I get a ride?

ROK
Don’t be lazy.

LI’S BODY CAM

She turns toward Fre.

LI (O.S.)
Do you really need one?

Fre doesn’t answer, he leaves the table.

LI (O.S.) (CONT’D)
I’ll pick you both up after Rok’s match. 

Sus back up on her feet, and ready to head off screen.

SUS
I’m done an hour before him. 

She leaves frame.

LI
I’m not going to make the trip twice.

Rok playing with his food:

ROK
A ride would be sweet.

SUS (O.S.)
I’ll be home.

LI
Every one make sure you’re all home later. We need to talk.

Li turns to Sus, running the water in the kitchen sink, removing Rok from frame.

SUS
About the divorce?

Li turns back to Rok, cutting Sus out of frame.

ROK
No one cares. We were hoping it’d stick after the first two.

Sus returns to the table, and hovers behind one of the stools. Sus and Rok are both in frame.

LI
Be home by 6pm or I’ll debit your weekly allowance.

A wave of euphoria strikes Sus.

A wave of nausea strikes Rok.

They both start to leave frame.

Li turns toward the BLACK BOX.

Though it might be afternoon, there is no sign of day or weather anywhere within the interior of this control room. 

The room is blacked out, all light falls from three connected screen panels filled with CAMERA FOOTAGE segmented into smaller screens from all the CAMERAS in the film.

In the center of the room, a group of SILHOUETTED FIGURES. They’re silhouettes are covered from head to toe in draped clothing. 

The silhouetted figures all hold a glass tablet in their hands. 

They are crouched, some stand, they are all watching the different screens. 

Taking notes and implementing commands into their tablets.

“ERV dash WORK”.

LI

(talking to ERV)
Hi...yeah, ordered 300 square meters already, tell JE to calm down...I don’t think I can meet today...I just can’t make it work today. And I wanted to tell you also that I’m going out of town for awhile.

She releases the tension in her back.

FRE’S BODY CAM

Fre sits down to work in front of his DESK TABLET.

He SUMMONS a series of three dimensional geometric shapes...

...then another series of smaller and larger similarly shaped geometric shapes, giving the last image more depth...

Plumbing and Electrical lines of a home take shape.

He switches between the layers of each of the patterning.

PAUSES.

Fre swipes left and SUMMONS a BROWSER.

He summons PORN in gloriously large renderings.

CENSORED.

PING.

PORN AUDIO cuts out, as does the obstructing CENSOR.

The DOOR to Fre’s drawing room SLIDES open.

A younger woman, NOL, enters, and lingers by the doorway.

Nol begins to come closer, she stops, and spits on the floor with the last word:

NOL
Out of breath? You’re a pig. Can’t control yourself. Good for nothing.

Fre’s up and out of his seat. He heads toward her, but away from her. They’re two animals circling each other.

FRE
Shut up, cunt.

He spits back at her.

NOL
How’s your wife?

FRE
Good. We’re getting divorced.

NOL
Oh, that’s nice. Whose idea was that?

Nol lets her hair down. The circling continues.

FRE
Mine. But I made her think it was hers.

NOL
This will be a nice change.

FRE
For us.

Fre pounces toward her. 

He grabs her in his arms.

Trying to kiss her.

She pushes him away -- 

TABLET CAM

NOL
For you.

Fre’s shoulders sink, his grip on her loosens and lessens.

Nol grabs him tighter, and shoves her tongue into his mouth. 

Fre comes back to life. 

They fall out of frame.

CUT TO:

INT. SUS’ STUDIO - AFTERNOON

SUS BODY CAM

PIROUETTES in front of a long mirror split in half by a ballet barre. 

The CAM spins rapidly, the surroundings are hard to distinguish.

Barely pronouncing the words, just under her breath in harsh exhales, she counts to twenty, faltering once briefly. 

The BODY CAM steadies as she finishes and holds her closing pose. 

We can now see other girls surrounding her doing their own practice. The studio space is large, individual girls stretch, a group sit on the ground and bullshit.

In the far back, and the only individual in black, a much older woman glowing with forced youth, MIS SAR, comes into focus...

...and lingers watching over Sus’s SHOULDER. 

Sus makes quick eye contact with Mis Sar, when she sees that Mis Sar had already been watching, her eyes retreat down to the floor.

Sus drops her pose. She tries to work a kink out of her shoulder. 

She tries to move down the studio, toward the right, drawing closer to the barre. Her reflection grows as she draws closer.

As does Mis Sar’s.

Mis Sar approaches quickly, and moves close enough to Sus’ ear to whisper.

MIS SAR
Almost perfect. Always just almost.

Sus spins around, she smiles.

SUS
Barely one mistake.

She spins back around, she places her leg on the barre and stretches her hamstring.

Mis Sar watches Sus for a moment, her lips clenched tight, then her eyes shift around the mirror checking on the other girls in the room.

BALLERINA FAR BACK CORNER MOBILE CAM

Mis Sar hovers over Sus. She makes quick eye contact with the camera through the mirror.

DANCING BALLERINA SELFIE CAM

As the DANCING BALLERINA records a selfie video of herself performing a dance, she catches quick glimpses of Mis Sar hovering over Sus.

MIS SAR (O.S.)
(whispering)
In my office.

HIGH ANGLE SECURITY CAM

We see everyone in the room for the first time. 

Mis Sar backs away from Sus. 

Sus takes a moment to herself --

SUS’ BODY CAM

She spins around and walks toward Mis Sar’s office.

As she passes the other girls congregate and start to whisper, she turns to them -- 

They’re all staring. Some look away. Some do not. 

She hurries out of the room, down a short hallway:

INT. MIS SAR’S OFFICE

SURVEILLANCE CAM

Sus takes a seat and closes her eyes.

Mis Sar enters the office and stands behind Sus.

She rubs her shoulders.

MIS SAR
Time to stretch up.

Sus rolls Mis Sar’s hands from her shoulders.

She stands up and turns towards her, arms crossed.

SUS
I’m stretched fine.

MIS SAR
My stars stretch.

Mis Sar points to the floor.

SUS
I know. I just don’t need it today.

MIS SAR

I can do pushups. Real pushups.
