# Narratological Protocol Worksheets
## For Analysis of *Open View* Drafts

> Three analytical lenses derived from distinct comedic traditions, plus a genre multiplicity framework for works where each character inhabits their own genre register.

---

## Protocol Suite

### Core Protocols

| Protocol | Source | Core Mechanism | Diagnostic Focus |
|----------|--------|----------------|------------------|
| **Fleabag** | Phoebe Waller-Bridge | Direct address + emotional deflection | Intimacy architecture, confession mechanics, fourth-wall strategy |
| **Curb** | Larry David | Collision comedy + social contract violation | Setup/payoff threading, embarrassment escalation, causal binding |
| **South Park** | Stone & Parker | Extreme position + satirical inversion | Thematic clarity, "therefore/but" logic, ideological stress-testing |

### Genre Multiplicity Extensions

| Document | Focus | When to Use |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Genre Multiplicity Extension** | Protocol-specific genre diagnostics | After completing core protocol worksheets |
| **Genre Architecture Worksheet** | Character-genre mapping, collision design | When characters each inhabit different genre registers |
| **Meta-Genre Container Analysis** | Surveillance as containing structure | When a meta-genre frames all character genres |

---

## Application Method

### Standard Protocol Analysis

1. **Run Each Core Worksheet Independently** — Complete all diagnostic questions for Fleabag, Curb, and South Park protocols
2. **Triangulate Findings** — Use synthesis matrix to compare results
3. **Generate Revision Notes** — Each worksheet concludes with targeted prompts

### Genre Multiplicity Analysis (Extended)

4. **Apply Genre Multiplicity Extension** — Add genre-awareness to each protocol's findings
5. **Complete Genre Architecture Worksheet** — Map character-genre assignments and collision points
6. **Analyze Meta-Genre Container** — Identify what genre "holds" all the character genres

### Triangulation Key

- Where protocols **converge** = structural strength
- Where protocols **diverge** = genre-specific opportunity
- Where all protocols **flag weakness** = critical revision target
- Where **genre multiplicity** creates complexity = architecture opportunity

## Target Drafts

| Draft | Date | Status | Notes |
|-------|------|--------|-------|
| First Draft | 2019-10-05 | P7 Complete | 27% causal binding; surveillance framework explicit |
| Second Draft | 2019-10-21 | P7 Complete | 78% causal binding; expanded structure |
| Third Draft | 2019-10-31 | Review Complete | Genre multiplicity experiment; character-specific registers |

---

## The Genre Multiplicity Thesis

The third draft introduces an explicit formal experiment:

> **Each character inhabits their own genre register. Genre collision becomes character collision.**

| Character | Assigned Genre | Genre Function |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Emma | Domestic Gothic / Melodrama | Emotional armor; sincerity as protection |
| Beth | Psychological Thriller | Information control; withholding as power |
| Clipper | Romantic Comedy | Performance as connection; rehearsed vulnerability |
| Helen | Corporate Satire / Mumblecore | Ironic distance; exhaustion as shield |
| Dayla | Competition Reality | Elimination anxiety; performance as survival |

### The Authorial Goal

> "Be genre-less, or be all the genres, or cycle through the genres as the scene/moment/beat demands."

This goal requires:
1. **Clear genre assignments** — Each character's "home genre" must be identifiable
2. **Intentional collisions** — Genre meetings must be architecturally designed
3. **Meta-genre container** — Something must hold all genres together
4. **Genre fluidity arc** — Characters (or the work) may transcend assigned genres

---

## Surveillance as Meta-Genre Container

The *Open View* premise offers **Surveillance Reality TV** as the meta-genre:

| Protocol | Surveillance Functions As... |
|----------|------------------------------|
| Fleabag | The audience within the world (characters always "watched") |
| Curb | Infinite witness multiplier (maximum embarrassment potential) |
| South Park | Position to satirize (both pro- and anti-surveillance extremes) |
| Genre Architecture | The force that assigns and enforces genre roles |

### Container Mechanics

```
SURVEILLANCE (meta-genre)
      │
      ├── Contains: All character genres as "performances"
      ├── Enforces: Genre roles through watching/judgment
      ├── Reveals: Genre as costume, not identity
      └── Climax: Characters discover/resist/transcend assignment
```

## Quick Start Guide

### For Standard Analysis
1. Complete Fleabag, Curb, and South Park worksheets
2. Fill in Synthesis Matrix
3. Prioritize revision based on triangulation

### For Genre-Multiplicity Analysis
1. Complete Genre Architecture Worksheet first
2. Then complete core protocols with genre-awareness
3. Apply Genre Multiplicity Extension to each protocol
4. Analyze Meta-Genre Container
5. Integrate findings into revision plan

### For *Open View* Specifically
1. Note that drafts 1-2 have surveillance explicit; draft 3 has genre multiplicity explicit
2. Use Meta-Genre Container document to connect both formal strategies
3. Track how clone/avatar system enables genre fluidity
