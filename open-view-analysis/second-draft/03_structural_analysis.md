## II. Structural Model Assessment

| Model | Fit (1-5) | Evidence |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Classical Three-Act** | ●●○○○ | Setup exists (I-II) but Act II sprawls into fragmentation; Act III compressed |
| **Five-Act (Shakespearean)** | ●●●○○ | Closer fit: Exposition (I) → Rising (II-III) → Climax (IV) → Falling (V) → Denouement (VI) |
| **Episodic/Picaresque** | ●●○○○ | Movement III has episodic quality but overall structure is goal-driven |
| **European Art Cinema** | ●●●●○ | Strong fit: Ambiguity, character interiority over action, open/cyclical ending |
| **Circular/Cyclical** | ●●●●● | Strongest fit: Sis becomes "Auntie," family trapped in loops, survival = next iteration |
| **Parallel/Braided** | ●●●●○ | Four family storylines run parallel in I/III; converge in IV |
| **Reverse Chronology** | ●○○○○ | Linear chronology with flashback coda (Dad's childhood) |
| **Hybrid: Cyclical-Parallel with Art Cinema Register** | ●●●●● | Best descriptor |

### Primary Structural Mode

OPEN VIEW operates as a **cyclical-parallel structure** rendered through a **European art cinema register**. The script braids four family storylines through three movements of increasing entanglement, culminating in a contracted death-game sequence that eliminates all but one. However, the sixth movement reveals this apparent resolution as merely another iteration: Sis's survival feeds her casting as "Auntie" in the next production, while Mom, Dad, and Son exist in parallel afterlife loops.

This is not three-act structure with a coda; it's a spiral that returns to its starting position one revolution higher (or lower). The dominant structural gesture is **recursion**: the family dysfunction that produced the opening conditions produces them again, infinitely.

The parallel storytelling of Movements I and III deliberately fragments audience attention, mimicking the family's disconnection. Movement IV's contraction into a single space forces convergence that the family had been avoiding. The structure thus argues its theme: these people can only be together when forced, and forced togetherness destroys them.

---

## III. Dramatic Spine

```
THESIS STATEMENT (if articulated in script):
"Why should I survive this? For what purpose?"
—Sis, Line 3122

AND: "You're going to get through this. It's going to be really, really hard. But you're going to make it."
—Mom, Line 3165

[These statements in dialectical tension: survival as meaningless vs. survival as imperative]

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

CONTROLLING IDEA:
SURVIVAL is achieved through SACRIFICE, but survival within a system
of recursive trauma merely perpetuates that trauma—there is no escape,
only transformation into the next iteration's victim or perpetrator.

Alternative formulation:
FAMILY LOVE is destroyed by the PERFORMANCE of family roles
until all that remains is the performance itself.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

CENTRAL DRAMATIC QUESTION:
Will MOM save her family from destruction despite the dysfunction
that has already fragmented them?

Answer provided: NO (ambiguous variant)
Mom fails to save the family—all die except Sis. But Mom's "failure"
is also the mechanism of Sis's survival. And Sis's survival is not
rescue but conscription into the next cycle.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PROTAGONIST CONFIGURATION:

  [X] Shifting protagonist (with primary focus)

  Name(s): MOM (primary), with SIS as secondary/inheriting protagonist

  Relationship to CDQ: Mom embodies the central question—she wants to
  hold the family together but her methods (secrets, control, sacrifice)
  accelerate dissolution. Sis inherits protagonist status in Movement VI,
  but as captive rather than agent.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

ANTAGONIST CONFIGURATION:

  [X] Institutional antagonist (system/organization)
  [X] Abstract antagonist (force/concept)

  Name(s)/Description:
  - HOME (the smart house / surveillance system)
  - THE SHOW (reality television apparatus, never personified)
  - FAMILY DYSFUNCTION (the internal antagonist made external)

  Relationship to CDQ: The antagonist forces are deliberately impersonal.
  The "game" has no visible operator—it simply activates. This abstracts
  the violence from individual agency, making it systemic/structural.
  The family's own dysfunction is weaponized against them.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## IV. Movement/Act Breakdown

### MOVEMENT I: "Separate Worlds"

**Lines:** 1 to 796
**Duration:** 796 lines (~21% of script)

**OPENING IMAGE:**
Location shots of glass structures; all family members asleep in separate beds. The world is established through fragmentation—we see isolation before we see any character's face.

**CLOSING IMAGE:**
Mom visits NEW SON in the basement tank; storm damages the house; a crack appears in the structure. The literal crack foreshadows the family's rupture; Mom's secret (the baby) is physically present but hidden below.

**DOMINANT DYNAMIC:**
Parallel isolation—four family members navigate separate crises without awareness of each other's struggles. The house contains them but does not connect them.

**INTERNAL STRUCTURE:**
```
MOVEMENT I: "Separate Worlds"
├── Sequence A: Domestic Baseline (Lines 1-55)
│   ├── Beat 1: Location establishing shots
│   ├── Beat 2: Family asleep separately
│   └── Beat 3: Mom in kitchen (drinking, commands, burned bird)
├── Sequence B: Four Worlds (Lines 59-375)
│   ├── Beat 4: Dad at restaurant with Work-Friend
│   ├── Beat 5: Sis hazed at auditorium
│   ├── Beat 6: Son in military training simulation
│   ├── Beat 7: Mom at lawyer (adoption consultation)
│   ├── Beat 8: Dad on beach, breakdown
│   └── Beat 9: Sis bathroom monologue/performance
├── Sequence C: Attempted Connections (Lines 378-691)
│   ├── Beat 10: Son invites Leader home
│   ├── Beat 11: Mom decides to give baby away
│   ├── Beat 12: Dad at spa, impotence
│   ├── Beat 13: Sis's performance chaos
│   └── Beat 14: Son brings Leader home; Mom's warning
└── Sequence D: Consequences/Plants (Lines 694-795)
    ├── Beat 15: Sis disciplined, leaving program
    ├── Beat 16: Dad begs for business trip
    └── Beat 17: Mom visits tank; storm; crack appears
```

**KEY TURNING POINTS:**
| Beat Name | Line | Event | Function |
|-----------|------|-------|----------|
| Kitchen Hook | 5-55 | Mom drinks alone, commands house, finds burned bird | Establishes domestic unease, smart-home presence |
| Lawyer Consultation | 268-333 | Mom learns she needs Dad's permission to give baby away | Stakes Mom's secret; creates dependency on Dad |
| Storm/Crack | 745-795 | House damaged; literal crack appears | Visual foreshadowing of family rupture |

**ASSESSMENT:**
Movement I succeeds at its primary task—establishing four distinct worlds of dysfunction—but the MEANWHILE structure (five consecutive parallel introductions) risks audience disengagement. The causal binding is intentionally weak because these characters are not interacting, but the script pays a price in momentum. The 21% proportion is appropriate for setup, though the material could be compressed by ~100 lines without loss.

---

### MOVEMENT II: "Convergence"

**Lines:** 798 to 1108
**Duration:** 310 lines (~8% of script)

**OPENING IMAGE:**
Mom wakes beside the tank; NEW SON's eyes flutter. The domestic and the uncanny merge—morning routine includes checking on the clone-baby.

**CLOSING IMAGE:**
Dad proposes having another baby at the restaurant. The proposal is a bomb: it contradicts Mom's secret plan and will (ironically) trigger the destruction Dad unknowingly courts.

**DOMINANT DYNAMIC:**
False unity—the family performs normalcy (beach day, sex, dinner) while secrets accumulate. This is the "calm before the storm" movement, structurally classical.

**INTERNAL STRUCTURE:**
```
MOVEMENT II: "Convergence"
├── Sequence A: Morning After (Lines 800-893)
│   ├── Beat 18: Mom wakes by tank
│   └── Beat 19: Family breakfast; blueberry pancakes
├── Sequence B: Beach Day (Lines 906-1007)
│   ├── Beat 20: Family at beach; cuddling
│   ├── Beat 21: Mom tries to confess; can't
│   └── Beat 22: Parents have sex
└── Sequence C: Restaurant Reversal (Lines 1010-1108)
    ├── Beat 23: Encounter with Auntie/Uncle; bathroom confrontation
    └── Beat 24: Dad proposes another baby [REVERSAL]
```

**KEY TURNING POINTS:**
| Beat Name | Line | Event | Function |
|-----------|------|-------|----------|
| Failed Confession | 943-998 | Mom tries to tell Dad about baby; can't speak | Establishes communication failure as family pattern |
| Baby Proposal | 1105-1108 | Dad proposes having another baby | Dramatic irony—audience knows about NEW SON; creates collision course |

**ASSESSMENT:**
This is the script's most conventionally structured movement—a rising THEREFORE chain (breakfast → beach → sex → restaurant → proposal) that creates classical dramatic irony. At 8%, it's appropriately brief; extending this false unity would undercut its fragility. The movement functions as contrast: this is what the family could be if they communicated honestly, which they cannot.

---

### MOVEMENT III: "Fragmentation"

**Lines:** 1110 to 1867
**Duration:** 757 lines (~20% of script)

**OPENING IMAGE:**
Dad at airport, reuniting with "Love" (Work-Friend). He's escaping the proposal he just made, already abandoning the family he claimed to want.

**CLOSING IMAGE:**
Son and Leader fight physically in a tunnel; Leader chokes Son; a wave crashes. Violence between intimates, environmental threat—the personal and systemic collide.

**DOMINANT DYNAMIC:**
Parallel descents—three storylines (Dad's affair/violence, Sis's audition humiliation, Son/Leader's conspiracy) proceed independently, each moving toward crisis.

**INTERNAL STRUCTURE:**
```
MOVEMENT III: "Fragmentation"
├── Sequence A: Dad's Descent (Lines 1112-1331)
│   ├── Beat 25: Dad travels; reunites with Love
│   ├── Beat 26: Dad can't perform sexually
│   ├── Beat 27: Dad masturbates to "Mom Clone" fantasy
│   ├── Beat 28: Dad assaults "Mom Clone" and Love [CLIMAX]
│   └── Beat 29: Dad returns beaten; Mom consoles
├── Sequence B: Sis's Degradation (Lines 1335-1580)
│   ├── Beat 30: Sis interviewed about leaked photos
│   ├── Beat 31: Agent pushes Sis to take roles
│   ├── Beat 32: Audition—asked to play "overbearing mom"
│   ├── Beat 33: Fantasy sequence: pornographic camp [FLAGGED]
│   └── Beat 34: Cast as frigid mom again
└── Sequence C: Son/Leader Conspiracy (Lines 1584-1866)
    ├── Beat 35: Morning intimacy; train ride
    ├── Beat 36: Leader reclaims leadership; they make love
    ├── Beat 37: Handling explosive materials; "wipe out a planet"
    ├── Beat 38: Jealousy confrontation; "this is my thing"
    └── Beat 39: Physical fight; choking; wave crashes [CLIMAX]
```

**KEY TURNING POINTS:**
| Beat Name | Line | Event | Function |
|-----------|------|-------|----------|
| Dad's Violence | 1255-1318 | Dad assaults "Mom Clone" and Love | Reveals Dad's capacity for violence; foreshadows his death |
| Explosives Revealed | 1670-1730 | Son and Leader handle explosives; discuss "wiping out a planet" | Plants the bombs that will destroy the house |
| Son/Leader Fight | 1757-1866 | Physical confrontation ends with choking | Establishes violence in their relationship; foreshadows Son's death |

**ASSESSMENT:**
Movement III is the script's structural weakness. The three parallel storylines each have internal coherence but lack binding to each other or to Movement II's central question. The causal binding score (~55%) falls below the adequate threshold. Beat 33 (camp fantasy) has no causal function and should be cut. Sis's audition circuit (beats 30-34) could be condensed to two beats. The movement needs ~150-200 lines cut and stronger connective tissue between storylines.

---

### MOVEMENT IV: "The Game"

**Lines:** 1868 to 3000
**Duration:** 1132 lines (~30% of script)

**OPENING IMAGE:**
Mom and Dad wake up having sex—shocked, as if the act happened without their consent. The doorbell rings. Violation of bodily autonomy and domestic space begin simultaneously.

**CLOSING IMAGE:**
Mom systematically kills the remaining survivors—Uncle, Sidekick, Leader—to ensure Sis's survival. Bodies on the floor. Mom as executioner.

**DOMINANT DYNAMIC:**
Entrapment and elimination—thirteen occupants trapped in a death game that kills one every five minutes until one remains. The family's dysfunction is literalized as lethal.

**INTERNAL STRUCTURE:**
```
MOVEMENT IV: "The Game"
├── Sequence A: Gathering (Lines 1870-2166)
│   ├── Beat 40: Parents wake having sex
│   ├── Beat 41: Auntie/Uncle arrive (changed minds about favor)
│   ├── Beat 42: Parents argue in basement; police arrive
│   └── Beat 43: All 13 occupants assembled; tensions mount
├── Sequence B: Game Activation (Lines 2168-2367)
│   ├── Beat 44: Uncle's dance fixation
│   ├── Beat 45: Wake Son; discover Leader; accusations
│   ├── Beat 46: Sis arrives in handcuffs
│   ├── Beat 47: HOME announces death game [INCITING INCIDENT]
│   └── Beat 48: NEW SON boiled alive [FIRST DEATH]
├── Sequence C: Chaos (Lines 2368-2766)
│   ├── Beat 49: Chaos after first death; crack widens
│   ├── Beat 50: Women argue
│   ├── Beat 51: Mom asks where Son is; Sis discovers Auntie's plan
│   ├── Beat 52: Mom finds Son; he admits explosives; wants quick death
│   ├── Beat 53: Dad proposes using explosives on door
│   ├── Beat 54: Sis searches for Son
│   ├── Beat 55: Sis finds Son dead; Officers tase corpse
│   └── Beat 56: Dad carries Son's body; Mister Leader electrocuted
└── Sequence D: Elimination (Lines 2770-3000)
    ├── Beat 57: Cops unified; Missus Leader attacks Boss
    ├── Beat 58: Family retreats to bar
    ├── Beat 59: Sidekick murders Missus Leader; fights begin
    ├── Beat 60: Mom hides with spike weapon
    ├── Beat 61: Dad kills Boss; Dad dies [CLIMAX PEAK]
    └── Beat 62: Mom kills remaining survivors [CLIMAX CONTINUATION]
```

**KEY TURNING POINTS:**
| Beat Name | Line | Event | Function |
|-----------|------|-------|----------|
| Game Announcement | 2281-2337 | HOME announces death game rules | True inciting incident; reframes all prior events |
| NEW SON Death | 2339-2367 | Baby boiled alive; shown on all screens | First death; establishes stakes as real; peak horror |
| Son's Death | 2675-2740 | Sis finds Son dead (beaten) under his bed | Eliminates Son's storyline; his explosives become Chekhov's gun |
| Dad's Death | 2929-2974 | Dad kills Boss, then dies fighting | Eliminates Dad; leaves Mom as last adult protector |
| Mom's Killings | 2976-3000 | Mom systematically kills Uncle, Sidekick, Leader | Mom transforms from passive to active; ensures Sis survives |

**ASSESSMENT:**
Movement IV is the script's strongest section structurally. The contraction into a single space forces interaction; the death-every-five-minutes mechanism creates relentless forward momentum; the causal binding is tight (~85% BUT/THEREFORE). At 30%, this movement is appropriately weighted as the script's center of gravity. The escalation from confusion → chaos → violence → systematic elimination is expertly paced.

---

### MOVEMENT V: "Survival/Sacrifice"

**Lines:** 3001 to 3205
**Duration:** 204 lines (~5% of script)

**OPENING IMAGE:**
Mom killing—Uncle, Sidekick, Leader fall in sequence. Sis protests. Mom has become what the game requires: a killer.

**CLOSING IMAGE:**
Explosives detonate. The house floods with toxic water. All bodies float. The structure that contained them destroys them.

**DOMINANT DYNAMIC:**
Two-character confrontation—Mom and Sis alone, negotiating survival and sacrifice. The dialogue is the script's thematic core.

**INTERNAL STRUCTURE:**
```
MOVEMENT V: "Survival/Sacrifice"
├── Sequence A: Final Eliminations (Lines 3001-3107)
│   ├── Beat 63: Mom kills Uncle, Sidekick, Leader
│   └── Beat 64: Sis vents grievances; Mom uses distraction
└── Sequence B: Self-Sacrifice Duel (Lines 3108-3205)
    ├── Beat 65: Mom wants to sacrifice herself; Sis asks "Why should I survive?"
    ├── Beat 66: Self-harm duel (knife competition) [CLIMAX]
    └── Beat 67: Explosives detonate; house floods
```

**KEY TURNING POINTS:**
| Beat Name | Line | Event | Function |
|-----------|------|-------|----------|
| Thematic Question | 3108-3130 | Sis: "Why should I survive this? For what purpose?" | Script's thesis articulated; no answer offered |
| Self-Harm Duel | 3131-3179 | Mom and Sis compete to stab themselves | Embodies mutual destruction; love expressed as violence |
| Detonation | 3181-3205 | Explosives from Son's subplot destroy the house | Plants pay off; structural collapse literalizes family collapse |

**ASSESSMENT:**
Movement V functions as extended climax—brief, intense, two-character. The "self-harm duel" is the script's most disturbing image and its thematic centerpiece. At 5%, this brevity is appropriate; extending would dilute the intensity. The unanswered question ("Why should I survive?") is deliberately left open—the script has no redemptive answer to offer.

---

### MOVEMENT VI: "Aftermath/Recursion"

**Lines:** 3206 to 3777
**Duration:** 571 lines (~16% of script)

**OPENING IMAGE:**
Sis survives, being prepared for an interview. Make-up covers acid damage. Her survival is immediately commodified.

**CLOSING IMAGE:**
Parallel hells: Mom alone at an empty dinner table; Dad's childhood assault continues; Son patched for more trench warfare; Sis aged-up and cast as "Auntie" in the new show. The cycle begins again.

**DOMINANT DYNAMIC:**
Revelation and recursion—survival is not escape but conscription into the next iteration. The game was a show; the show produces more shows.

**INTERNAL STRUCTURE:**
```
MOVEMENT VI: "Aftermath/Recursion"
├── Sequence A: Winner's Circuit (Lines 3207-3346)
│   ├── Beat 68: Sis prepared for interview
│   ├── Beat 69: Sis interviewed as "winner"
│   └── Beat 70: Mom at empty family dinner
├── Sequence B: Afterlife Loops (Lines 3348-3427)
│   ├── Beat 71: Dad as child during naptime
│   └── Beat 72: Son in WWI trenches
├── Sequence C: Production Continuation (Lines 3430-3519)
│   ├── Beat 73: Sis pitched new projects
│   ├── Beat 74: Mom leaves gathering; messages Dad
│   └── Beat 75: Dad's childhood assault continues
├── Sequence D: Final Recursion (Lines 3521-3777)
│   ├── Beat 76: Son's trench war continues
│   ├── Beat 77: Sis cast as "Auntie" in new show [REVEAL]
│   └── Beat 78: Parallel hells continue; cycle closes
```

**KEY TURNING POINTS:**
| Beat Name | Line | Event | Function |
|-----------|------|-------|----------|
| Media Reveal | 3238-3286 | Sis interviewed as "winner"; hollow teleprompter answers | Reveals the game as entertainment; survival as product |
| Sis as Auntie | 3620-3658 | Sis aged up, cast as "Auntie" in next iteration | Cyclical structure completes; Sis becomes Mom becomes Auntie |
| Parallel Hells | 3660-3777 | All family members in separate eternal loops | Confirms no escape; survival is another kind of death |

**ASSESSMENT:**
Movement VI is structurally risky—it operates as a coda that reconceptualizes everything preceding it. The tonal shift from thriller intensity to melancholic surrealism may lose audiences who expected resolution. At 16%, this movement is proportionally significant, arguing that the "aftermath" is not less important than the "event." The parallel MEANWHILE structure deliberately weakens causal binding (~40%) to emphasize disconnection and eternal recurrence.

The reveal that Sis will become "Auntie" closes the cyclical structure but raises questions the script doesn't answer: Who runs the show? Is this hell literal or metaphorical? These ambiguities are features, not bugs—the script operates in art cinema register where resolution is suspect.

## V. Complete Turning Point Inventory

| Node | Line | Event | Structural Function |
|------|------|-------|---------------------|
| **HOOK** | 5-55 | Mom in kitchen: drinking, commanding house, burned bird | Captures attention; establishes unease |
| **WORLD ESTABLISHED** | 1-375 | Four family members in separate dysfunctions | Baseline for disruption |
| **INCITING INCIDENT (False)** | 1105-1108 | Dad proposes another baby | Appears to launch question; actually misdirection |
| **INCITING INCIDENT (True)** | 2281-2337 | HOME announces death game | Actual launch of dramatic question |
| **DEBATE/REFUSAL** | 2368-2500 | Chaos; attempts to escape; denial | Characters resist new reality |
| **LOCK-IN** | 2339-2367 | NEW SON boiled alive | No return possible; first death proves stakes |
| **MIDPOINT** | 2675-2740 | Son found dead; explosives located | Raises stakes; introduces endgame weapon |
| **BAD GUYS CLOSE IN** | 2770-2928 | Escalating violence; deaths accelerate | Pressure maximizes |
| **ALL IS LOST** | 2929-2974 | Dad dies | Last adult male protector eliminated |
| **DARK NIGHT** | 3108-3130 | Sis: "Why should I survive?" | Crystallizes thematic question |
| **CLIMAX INITIATED** | 2976-3000 | Mom begins killing survivors | Mom takes full agency |
| **CLIMAX PEAK** | 3131-3179 | Self-harm duel; explosives detonate | Highest intensity; structural destruction |
| **RESOLUTION (False)** | 3207-3286 | Sis survives; interviewed as winner | Appears to resolve; actually new beginning |
| **FINAL IMAGE** | 3660-3777 | Parallel hells; Sis cast as "Auntie" | Cyclical return; no escape |

**Note:** The script delays its true inciting incident until line 2281 (~60% through the script). This is unconventional but defensible: the family drama of Movements I-III is reframed as "setup for the show" once the game begins. The delay creates the script's central formal gambit—everything changes once the game starts.

### Intensity Annotations

| Point | Line | Intensity | Note |
|-------|------|-----------|------|
| Opening | 1-55 | 2-3 | Deliberately subdued; unease through implication |
| Movement I Peak | 203-265 | 6 | Son's training simulation; action spike |
| Movement II Peak | 1105-1108 | 7 | Dad's proposal; dramatic irony creates tension |
| Movement III Peak | 1255-1318 | 8 | Dad's violent assault |
| Game Announcement | 2281-2337 | 9 | True inciting incident; rules of death |
| NEW SON Death | 2339-2367 | 10 | First death; peak horror |
| Dad's Death | 2929-2974 | 10 | Climax peak |
| Self-Harm Duel | 3131-3179 | 10 | Sustained peak intensity |
| Recursion Reveal | 3620-3658 | 6 | Dread replaces action intensity |
| Final Image | 3660-3777 | 5 | Melancholic settling |

## VII. Proportional Analysis

| Section | Current Lines | Current % | Classical Target % | Variance | Assessment |
|---------|---------------|-----------|-------------------|----------|------------|
| Setup (Mov I-II) | 1,106 | 29% | 20-25% | +4-9% | Slightly front-heavy |
| Confrontation (Mov III-IV) | 1,889 | 50% | 50-55% | On target | Appropriate |
| Resolution (Mov V-VI) | 775 | 21% | 20-25% | On target | Appropriate |

**Alternative Analysis (6-Movement Structure):**

| Movement | Lines | % | Function | Assessment |
|----------|-------|---|----------|------------|
| I: Separate Worlds | 796 | 21% | Setup | Could compress ~100 lines |
| II: Convergence | 310 | 8% | False Unity | Appropriate brevity |
| III: Fragmentation | 757 | 20% | Parallel Descent | Needs ~150-200 lines cut |
| IV: The Game | 1,132 | 30% | Climactic Sequence | Appropriately weighted |
| V: Sacrifice | 204 | 5% | Denouement I | Appropriately brief |
| VI: Recursion | 571 | 16% | Denouement II | May feel long for coda |

**Assessment:**
The script's proportions work within the unconventional structure it establishes. The primary proportion issue is Movement III's ~20% dedicated to parallel storylines that feel episodic. If 150-200 lines were cut from Movement III and redistributed to Movement II (extending the false unity) or VI (deepening the recursion), the proportional balance would improve without altering the script's formal intentions.

## VIII. Structural Anomalies & Features

- [X] Non-linear chronology (Movement VI introduces childhood flashback)
- [ ] Unreliable narrator
- [ ] Frame narrative
- [X] Multiple timelines (Movement VI's parallel afterlives)
- [X] Structural repetition (Sis becomes Auntie; cycle closes)
- [X] Intentional symmetry (opening isolated sleepers ↔ closing parallel hells)
- [X] Genre subversion (domestic drama → reality TV death game → existential meditation)
- [X] Other: **Delayed inciting incident** (true inciting incident at 60%)

**Description:**

1. **Delayed Inciting Incident:** The true inciting incident (game announcement, line 2281) occurs approximately 60% through the script. This is a significant structural gambit—Movements I-III function as "setup for the show" that the audience doesn't know they're watching. The delay is defensible because it reframes all prior material retrospectively, but it risks losing audiences who expect earlier engagement.

2. **Genre Fluidity:** The script moves through at least three distinct genre registers:
   - Movements I-III: Domestic melodrama / European art cinema
   - Movement IV-V: Reality TV death game / horror thriller
   - Movement VI: Existential meditation / recursive metafiction

   This fluidity serves the script's argument (entertainment consumes all registers) but creates tonal whiplash.

3. **Cyclical Closure:** The final image (Sis cast as "Auntie") doesn't resolve the narrative but restarts it. This is the script's defining structural gesture—resolution is impossible because the system generates new iterations. The "ending" is a beginning.

4. **Parallel Afterlives:** Movement VI introduces what appear to be literal afterlife loops (Mom at empty dinners, Dad's childhood, Son's trench warfare). Whether these are meant as metaphor, supernatural, or additional "shows" is deliberately ambiguous. This ambiguity is a feature of art cinema structure but may frustrate genre audiences.

## IX. Structural Diagnosis Summary

**Strongest Structural Element:** Movement IV's contracted death-game sequence demonstrates expert control of escalation, causal binding, and intensity management. This is the script's structural center of gravity and its most commercially viable section.

**Weakest Structural Element:** Movement III's parallel descents sprawl without sufficient binding to each other or to the central dramatic question. The causal binding score (~55%) falls below adequate threshold and the movement contains the script's only genuinely cuttable material (beat 33, camp fantasy).

**Primary Structural Tension:** The script operates in two modes—parallel/diffuse (Movements I, III, VI) and contracted/intense (Movements II, IV, V). This alternation is thematically purposeful (the family can only connect under duress) but creates pacing challenges. The transitions between modes are abrupt rather than graduated.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Compress Movement III** by 150-200 lines. Cut beat 33 entirely. Reduce Sis's audition sequence to two beats maximum. Consider interleaving Dad/Sis/Son descents more tightly rather than sequencing them.

2. **Strengthen Movement II** by extending the false unity—give the family one more scene together before Dad leaves for his trip. This deepens the irony and gives audiences more investment in what's about to shatter.

3. **Clarify or commit** on Movement VI's parallel afterlives. Currently the script hedges between literal (supernatural) and metaphorical (thematic) readings. Either interpretation works, but the current version may feel like ambiguity rather than purposeful openness.
