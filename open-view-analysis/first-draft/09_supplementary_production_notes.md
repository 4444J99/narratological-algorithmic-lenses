# *Open View* — Production Notes (Supplementary)

**Draft:** First Draft (2018-03-29)
**Analyst:** Claude (script-analysis-dramaturgical)
**Analysis Date:** 2026-01-25
**Protocol:** P7 Full Analytical Treatment
**Supplement:** A

## I. Production Viability Assessment

### Budget Tier

**Assessment:** Low-Medium ($5-15M)

*Note: Budget assessment based on incomplete first draft. Final budget will depend on second draft scope.*

| Factor | Requirement | Budget Impact |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **Locations** | Glass house (primary); hotel; McDonald's; restaurants; ballet studio; wrestling gym; various interiors | Moderate |
| **Period/Scope** | Near-future; contemporary with speculative elements | Low-Moderate |
| **VFX Load** | Grow tank (primary); quadrant visual effects; house lockdown/destruction | Moderate |
| **Cast** | Ensemble (7 principal roles); day players (affair partners, youth characters) | Moderate |
| **Specialized Elements** | Grow tank practical/VFX hybrid; child death sequence; violence choreography | Significant |

---

## II. Key Production Challenges

### 1. The Glass House

**Requirement:**
- Central location for ~50% of screen time
- Must accommodate 7 family members + crew
- Needs to feel both domestic and surveilled
- Glass/transparent architecture for visibility
- Basement with grow tank room
- Must support lockdown/siege mechanics

**Approach Options:**
1. **Purpose-built set** — Maximum control; highest cost
2. **Existing modernist house + modification** — Location scout for glass houses
3. **Hybrid approach** — Location exteriors + studio interiors

**Challenge:** Finding architecture that reads as both "home" and "prison"

---

### 2. Grow Tank Sequence

**Requirement:**
- Lef (infant-sized figure) floats in floor-to-ceiling liquid vat
- Body must be "scaly, yellow, tissue/veins/bone visible"
- Tank temperature rises; body "writhes, jerks, sputters"
- "Blood shoots from orifices. Skin loosens and peels."
- Heart rate monitor shows nil

**Approach Options:**
1. **Full practical** — Animatronic/prosthetic in practical tank
2. **VFX** — Digital creature in digital environment
3. **Hybrid** — Practical tank with VFX creature enhancement

**Recommendation:** Hybrid approach. Practical tank with minimal liquid (for reflections/lighting), digital Lef composited in. Death sequence requires careful VFX to achieve horror without exploitation.

---

### 3. Violence Choreography

**Violence Sequences:**
- Li stomps Def's face with boot heel
- Family watches Lef die (emotional violence)
- Rok drowns with Gre in flooding shower
- Additional violence in incomplete Act III

**Requirements:**
- Stunt coordinator for physical violence
- Water safety coordinator for shower drowning
- Intimacy coordinator for violence adjacent to sexuality

---

### 4. Quadrant Visual Treatment

**Requirement:**
- Opening 162 lines use split-screen quadrant format
- Each quadrant shows different family member's private ritual
- Quadrants have "polyrhythmic" timing before syncing
- Merge into single widescreen image

**Approach:**
- Shoot all four quadrants as full coverage
- Post-production assembly into split-screen
- Visual effects for "CENSORED" blur
- Visual effects for "LOOP" repetition

---

## III. Cast Breakdown

### Principal Cast

| Role | Age | Description | Notes |
|------|-----|-------------|-------|
| **LI** | 40s | Mother; primary protagonist | Requires: range from controlled to violent; physical demands |

| **SUS** | 17 | Daughter; ballerina | Requires: abuse victim; ballet proficiency or double |
| **ROK** | 16 | Son; wrestler | Requires: athletic build; eating disorder portrayal; LGBTQ representation |
| **LEF** | Infant | Grow tank child | Practical/VFX—no live actor |

### Secondary Cast

### Youth Actor Considerations

**Sus (17):**
- Abuse subplot requires careful handling
- Ballet double may be needed for pirouettes
- No nudity (CENSORED in script)

**Rok (16):**
- Eating disorder portrayal
- LGBTQ representation (closeted/questioning)
- Drowning sequence requires water safety

**Em (16-17):**
- Rejection scene; emotional but not physical

**Gre (16-17):**
- Drowning sequence
- Embrace with Rok

*Recommend all youth actors be 18+ playing younger.*

## VII. Schedule Estimate

**Based on incomplete draft. Final schedule requires completed script.**

| Phase | Days | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| **Prep** | 8-10 weeks | Includes tank construction |
| **Principal Photography** | 25-30 days | |
| **Post-Production** | 16-20 weeks | Heavy VFX load for tank |

### Shooting Order Considerations

1. **Glass house exteriors:** Weather dependent; schedule early
2. **Grow tank sequences:** Complex setup; block together
3. **Quadrant overture:** Shoot each quadrant separately
4. **Violence sequences:** Schedule at end to protect actor relationships
5. **HQ sequences:** May be cut; schedule flexibly

## VIII. Comparable Productions

### Budget/Production Reference

| Title | Budget | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| *Coherence* (2013) | $50K | Single location; no VFX |
| *The Invitation* (2015) | $1M | Single location dinner party |
| *mother!* (2017) | $30M | Single location; escalating chaos |
| *Parasite* (2019) | $11M | Two primary locations; class critique |
| *The Platform* (2019) | $2M (est.) | Single concept; limited VFX |

**Assessment:** *Open View* sits between *The Invitation* and *mother!* in ambition. The grow tank VFX is the primary budget driver. Without it, the film could be made for $3-5M. With full tank realization, budget rises to $10-15M.

### Tonal Reference

| Title | Connection |
|-------|------------|
| *Dogtooth* (2009) | Family as closed system; stylized violence |
| *Funny Games* (2007) | Home invasion; metafictional cruelty |
| *The Lobster* (2015) | Deadpan dystopia; relationship commentary |
| *Under the Skin* (2013) | Surveillance; body horror; art cinema |

---

## IX. Market Positioning

### Primary Market

**Festival Circuit → Art House Theatrical → Streaming**

Comparable trajectory:
- *The Lobster*: Cannes premiere → limited theatrical → streaming
- *mother!*: Venice premiere → wide theatrical (polarizing) → streaming

### Target Festivals

| Festival | Fit | Section |
|----------|-----|---------|
| **Venice** | Strong | Competition or Horizons |
| **Toronto** | Strong | Midnight Madness or Platform |
| **Sundance** | Moderate | NEXT or Midnight |

## X. Production Recommendation

**HOLD FOR SECOND DRAFT**

The current first draft is structurally incomplete. Production planning should wait until:

1. Third act is completed
2. HQ subplot is resolved (cut or integrated)
3. Violence sequences are fully scripted
4. Youth actor scenes are finalized

**Not Recommended:**
- Proceeding with incomplete script
- Budgeting until VFX scope is determined
- Casting until character arcs are complete

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Complete second draft
2. VFX concept development for grow tank
3. Location scout for glass house
4. Budget refinement based on final script
