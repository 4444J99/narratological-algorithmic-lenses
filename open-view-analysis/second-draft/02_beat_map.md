## MOVEMENT I — "SEPARATE WORLDS"
### Lines 1-796 | ~21% of script

| 17 | 745-795 | Home/Basement | **Mom**, Son, Leader | Mom visits NEW SON in tank; storm damages house; crack revealed | PLANT/HOOK | 6 | THEREFORE |

### Movement I Notes

**[DRAMATURGIST]:** Movement I establishes all four family members in isolated, dysfunctional spheres. The primary structural issue is the MEANWHILE connections—five consecutive parallel introductions without causal binding. However, this fragmentation is thematically intentional: the family exists in separate worlds even while sharing a home.

**Key Plants:** Mom's lawyer consultation (line 268); NEW SON in tank (line 757); house crack (line 788); Son's mention to Leader about "explosive materials" is deferred to later.

**Tension Curve:** Fluctuates 3-6, average 4.2. Appropriately low for establishment, with Son's training sequence providing brief action spike.

---

## MOVEMENT II — "CONVERGENCE"
### Lines 798-1108 | ~8% of script

*The family attempts normalcy; past and present collide*

| # | Lines | Setting | Characters | Action | Function | Tension | Connector |
|---|-------|---------|------------|--------|----------|---------|-----------|
| 18 | 800-822 | Nursery | **Mom**, Dad (O.S.) | Morning after storm; Mom wakes by tank; NEW SON's eyes flutter | SETUP | 4 | BUT |
| 19 | 824-893 | Kitchen/Foyer | **Mom**, Dad, Sis, Son | Family breakfast; blueberry pancakes; Mom cries; Dad proposes beach day | RELATIONSHIP | 3 | THEREFORE |
| 20 | 906-943 | Beach | **Mom**, Dad, Sis, Son | Family beach day; Mom and Dad cuddle; Mom wants to confess something | TEST | 4 | THEREFORE |
| 21 | 943-998 | Beach | **Mom**, Dad | Mom tries to tell Dad about baby; can't say it; Dad proposes dinner date | ESCALATE | 5 | BUT |
| 22 | 1000-1007 | Bedroom | **Mom**, Dad | Mom and Dad have sex; Mom orgasms | RELATIONSHIP | 4 | THEREFORE |
| 23 | 1010-1107 | Chinese Restaurant | **Mom**, Dad, Auntie, Uncle | Date night; encounter Auntie/Uncle; bathroom confrontation; Auntie says she'll do "the favor" | ESCALATE | 5 | THEREFORE |
| 24 | 1105-1108 | Restaurant | Dad, **Mom** | Dad proposes: "Let's have another baby" | REVERSE | 7 | BUT |

### Movement II Notes

**[DRAMATURGIST]:** This brief movement creates a false domestic idyll—the family together, functioning. The structure is classical: rising intimacy leading to proposal that will (ironically) shatter everything. Dad's proposal directly contradicts Mom's plan to give the baby away, creating the central dramatic irony.

**Causal Binding:** Strong THEREFORE chain from breakfast → beach → sex → restaurant → proposal. This is the script's most conventionally structured sequence.

---

## MOVEMENT III — "FRAGMENTATION"
### Lines 1110-1867 | ~20% of script

*Parallel descents: Dad's trip, Sis's career, Son's conspiracy*

| # | Lines | Setting | Characters | Action | Function | Tension | Connector |
|---|-------|---------|------------|--------|----------|---------|-----------|
| 25 | 1112-1158 | Airport/Plane | Dad, Love | Dad travels; reunites with "Love" (Work-Friend); kiss in airport | SETUP | 4 | MEANWHILE |

| 27 | 1208-1253 | Pool/Bathroom | Dad, Love, Mom Clone | Dad spots woman resembling Mom; masturbates successfully to fantasy | THEMATIC | 5 | BUT |
| 28 | 1255-1318 | Hotel Room/Hallway | Dad, Love, New Love | "Mom Clone" arrives at door; Dad assaults her; assaults Love | CLIMAX | 8 | BUT |
| 29 | 1320-1331 | Home | Dad, **Mom** | Dad returns beaten; cries "I hate this" repeatedly; Mom consoles | CONSEQUENCE | 6 | THEREFORE |
| 30 | 1335-1388 | Press Circuit | Sis, Nym | Sis interviewed about leaked photos; explicit footage plays behind | SETUP | 4 | MEANWHILE |
| 31 | 1391-1438 | FaceTime | Sis, Agent | Agent pushes Sis to take roles; Sis frustrated by typecasting | TEST | 4 | THEREFORE |
| 32 | 1440-1487 | Casting Couch | Sis, Suits | Sis auditions for yacht show; asked to do "overbearing mom bit" instead | TEST | 5 | THEREFORE |
| 33 | 1489-1537 | Camp Setting | Sis, Actor, Actress | Fantasy sequence: Sis in pornographic camp scenario | THEMATIC | 4 | AND THEN |
| 34 | 1540-1580 | Casting Couch | Sis, Suits | Another audition; Sis gets cast as frigid mom again; escorted out | CONSEQUENCE | 5 | THEREFORE |
| 35 | 1584-1666 | Son's Bedroom/Train | Son, Leader | Son and Leader's morning intimacy; train ride; growing closeness | RELATIONSHIP | 4 | MEANWHILE |
| 36 | 1636-1667 | Pizzeria/Bedroom | Son, Leader | Leader reclaims leadership; Son accepts subordinate role; they make love | RELATIONSHIP | 5 | THEREFORE |
| 37 | 1670-1730 | Leader's Bedroom | Son, Leader | Son and Leader handle explosive materials; discuss "wiping out a planet" | PLANT | 7 | THEREFORE |
| 38 | 1731-1755 | Pizzeria/Tunnel | Son, Leader | Son jealous of "Number Two"; confrontation; Son says "this is my thing" | ESCALATE | 6 | BUT |
| 39 | 1757-1866 | Street/Tunnel | Son, Leader | Physical fight; Leader chokes Son; wave crashes | CLIMAX | 8 | THEREFORE |

### Movement III Notes

**[DRAMATURGIST]:** This movement suffers from structural sprawl—three parallel storylines (Dad/Love, Sis/auditions, Son/Leader) proceed with MEANWHILE connections. The individual sequences are causally coherent internally but lack binding to each other or to Movement II's central question (Dad's baby proposal vs. Mom's plan).

**Causal Binding Score:** ~55% BUT/THEREFORE. Below threshold (60-80% adequate). The AND THEN connection at beat 33 (Sis's fantasy sequence) particularly flags for revision—this beat could be cut entirely.

**Flagged Issues:**
- Beats 30-34 (Sis's audition circuit) could be condensed to 2 beats maximum
- Beat 33 (camp fantasy) has no causal connection to surrounding material
- Dad's return (beat 29) resolves his subplot too quickly—consider extending consequences

## MOVEMENT IV — "THE GAME"
### Lines 1868-3000 | ~30% of script

*Entrapment, revelation, violence, survival*

| # | Lines | Setting | Characters | Action | Function | Tension | Connector |

| 44 | 2168-2180 | Foyer | Cops, Uncle | Uncle repeatedly mentions "expensive tickets to dance" | THEMATIC | 5 | AND THEN |
| 45 | 2184-2262 | Son's Room | **Mom**, Son, Leader, Cops, Parents | Wake Son; discover naked Leader; accusations fly | ESCALATE | 7 | THEREFORE |
| 46 | 2268-2279 | Son's Room | All | Police alarm—Sis arrives with more officers in handcuffs | ESCALATE | 7 | BUT |

| 49 | 2368-2408 | Foyer | All | Chaos after first death; crack widens; cops try door; toxic glow visible | ESCALATE | 8 | THEREFORE |
| 50 | 2409-2434 | Foyer (Women) | **Mom**, Auntie, Missus Leader | Women argue; Auntie blames Mom; Missus Leader defensive | RELATIONSHIP | 7 | MEANWHILE |
| 51 | 2436-2500 | Foyer | All | Mom asks where Son is; reveals room was glowing; Sis discovers Auntie's plan | REVEAL | 8 | BUT |
| 52 | 2506-2575 | Upstairs/Sis's Room | **Mom**, Son | Mom finds Son under Sis's bed; he admits hiding explosives; wants to die quickly | REVEAL | 8 | THEREFORE |
| 53 | 2576-2600 | Foyer | Dad, Others | Mom announces explosives; Dad proposes using them to blow door | CHOICE | 7 | THEREFORE |

| 62 | 2976-3000 | Foyer | **Mom**, Sis, Leader, Uncle, Sidekick | Mom systematically kills remaining survivors; stranges Uncle, kills Sidekick, kills Leader | CLIMAX | 10 | THEREFORE |

### Movement IV Notes

**[DRAMATURGIST]:** Movement IV is the script's structural center—the game sequence operates at consistently high tension (7-10 range) with strong THEREFORE/BUT causation. The escalation is systematic: death → chaos → violence → systematic elimination. Mom's transformation from passive observer to active killer is the arc's payoff.

**Causal Binding Score:** ~85% BUT/THEREFORE. Strong.

**Peak Tension Beats:**
- Beat 48 (NEW SON death): 10
- Beat 61 (Dad dies): 10
- Beat 62 (Mom's killings): 10

---

## MOVEMENT V — "SURVIVAL/SACRIFICE"
### Lines 3001-3205 | ~5% of script

*Mom and Sis's final confrontation*

| # | Lines | Setting | Characters | Action | Function | Tension | Connector |
|---|-------|---------|------------|--------|----------|---------|-----------|
| 63 | 3001-3078 | Foyer/Fireplace | **Mom**, Sis, Leader | Mom kills Uncle, Sidekick, Leader; Sis protests; Mom urges Sis to talk | CLIMAX | 9 | THEREFORE |

| 65 | 3108-3130 | Foyer | **Mom**, Sis | Mom wants to sacrifice herself; Sis asks "Why should I survive?" | THEMATIC | 9 | BUT |
| 66 | 3131-3179 | Foyer/Kitchen | **Mom**, Sis | Mom stabs herself; Sis grabs knife; self-harm duel | CLIMAX | 10 | THEREFORE |
| 67 | 3181-3205 | Home/Exterior | Sis, **Mom**, All Bodies | Explosives detonate; house floods with toxic water; all bodies float | CLIMAX | 10 | THEREFORE |

### Movement V Notes

**[DRAMATURGIST]:** The shortest movement functions as extended climax—a two-character confrontation stretched across rising violence. The "self-harm duel" (beat 66) is the script's most disturbing image, emblematizing the family's mutual destruction.

**Thematic Function:** Mom's sacrifice is not redemptive—it's another form of control. Sis's question "Why should I survive?" goes unanswered because the script has no answer to offer.

---

## MOVEMENT VI — "AFTERMATH/RECURSION"
### Lines 3206-3777 | ~16% of script

*Survival as product; cyclical return*

| # | Lines | Setting | Characters | Action | Function | Tension | Connector |
|---|-------|---------|------------|--------|----------|---------|-----------|
| 68 | 3207-3237 | Home/Sis's Room | Sis, Emergency Personnel, Make-Up | Sis survives; being prepared for interview; acid damage repaired | CONSEQUENCE | 4 | BUT |
| 69 | 3238-3286 | Interview Set | Sis, Reporter, Viewers | Sis interviewed as "winner"; reads teleprompter; hollow answers | THEMATIC | 5 | THEREFORE |
| 70 | 3288-3346 | Dining Room | **Mom**, Extended Family | Mom at family dinner; alone; four empty chairs; gossip about her | THEMATIC | 4 | MEANWHILE |
| 71 | 3348-3385 | Kindergarten | Dad, Mate, Peer | Dad as child during naptime; friends wake him; sneak outside | THEMATIC | 3 | MEANWHILE |
| 72 | 3388-3427 | WWI Trenches | Son, Leader, Soldiers | Son in trench warfare; follows Leader over top; both shot | THEMATIC | 7 | MEANWHILE |
| 73 | 3430-3477 | Fancy Restaurant | Sis, Executives | Sis pitched projects; surrounded by sycophants; black bile on food | THEMATIC | 5 | THEREFORE |
| 74 | 3480-3519 | Outside Apartment/Rideshare | **Mom** | Mom leaves family gathering; messages Dad with no response | THEMATIC | 4 | MEANWHILE |
| 75 | 3521-3564 | Playground/Ball Pit | Dad, Mate, Peer | Dad's childhood: friends attempt sexual assault in ball pit | THEMATIC | 6 | MEANWHILE |
| 76 | 3566-3618 | No Man's Land | Son, Leader | Son continues in trench war; Leader shot; both fall into spike pit | THEMATIC | 7 | MEANWHILE |
| 77 | 3620-3658 | Dressing Room | Sis, Make-Up, Agent | Sis aged up to look like Mom; cast as "Aunt" in new show | REVEAL | 6 | THEREFORE |
| 78 | 3660-3777 | Various | **Mom**, Dad, Son, Sis | Parallel hells: Mom alone in empty home; Dad's assault continues; Son patched for more war; Sis in new show | RESOLVE | 5 | THEREFORE |

### Movement VI Notes

**[DRAMATURGIST]:** Movement VI operates as coda/epilogue but also as structural revelation—the entire preceding narrative was a "show," and Sis's survival feeds directly into casting for the next iteration. The parallel MEANWHILE beats (Mom's dinner, Dad's childhood, Son's trench) suggest eternal recurrence/punishment loops.

**Structural Risk:** This movement feels like a different film. The tonal shift from high-intensity thriller to melancholic/surreal meditation may lose audiences. However, the thematic payoff is essential—survival is not escape; it's conscription into the next cycle.

**Causal Binding:** Deliberately weak (~40% THEREFORE). The MEANWHILE connections emphasize disconnection/parallelism rather than causation.

## Beat Statistics

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Total beats | 78 | |
| Average tension | 5.8 | Within target range (5-6) |
| Peak tension beats (9-10) | 8 | Appropriate for thriller |
| Low tension beats (1-3) | 6 (8%) | Acceptable |
| **BUT connectors** | 18 (23%) | Below target (30-40%) |
| **THEREFORE connectors** | 42 (54%) | Above target (40-50%) |
| **MEANWHILE connectors** | 15 (19%) | Above target (<10%) |
| **AND THEN connectors** | 2 (3%) | Acceptable (<10%) |

### Causal Binding Score

```
CAUSAL_BINDING = (BUT + THEREFORE) / (TOTAL_CONNECTORS - 1) × 100

Score: (18 + 42) / 77 × 100 = 78%

Interpretation:
  >80%: Strong causal binding
✓ 60-80%: Adequate binding, some episodic elements
  40-60%: Weak binding, significant revision needed
  <40%: Fundamental structural issue
```

**Assessment:** Overall causal binding is adequate (78%), though Movement III drags the average down. The high MEANWHILE count reflects intentional parallel storytelling but risks audience disconnection.

## Flagged Beats

| Beat # | Issue | Recommendation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| 2 | AND THEN connector after opening | Minor—establishing shot sequence |
| 33 | AND THEN—Camp fantasy | Cut or integrate; no causal function |
| 44 | AND THEN—Uncle's dance fixation | Intentional comic relief but risks distraction |
| 70-76 | MEANWHILE cluster | Intentional but requires viewer patience; consider interleaving differently |
