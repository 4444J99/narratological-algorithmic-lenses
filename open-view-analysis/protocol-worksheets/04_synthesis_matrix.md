# Protocol Synthesis Matrix
## Cross-Protocol Comparison & Triangulation Grid

> Use this matrix after completing all three protocol worksheets. Triangulation reveals where protocols converge (structural strength), diverge (genre opportunity), or universally flag weakness (critical revision target).

## 1. Draft Identification

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Draft Title** | |
| **Draft Date** | |
| **Page Count** | |
| **Analyst** | |
| **Date of Analysis** | |

---

## 2. Protocol Scores Summary

| Protocol | Score | Max | Percentage | Alignment |
|----------|-------|-----|------------|-----------|
| Fleabag | /12 | 12 | % | Strong / Partial / Weak |
| Curb | /18 | 18 | % | Strong / Partial / Weak |
| South Park | /18 | 18 | % | Strong / Partial / Weak |

**Composite Score:** _____ / 48 = _____%

## 3. Causal Binding Comparison

All three protocols prioritize causal connection. Compare findings:

| Metric | Fleabag Finding | Curb Finding | South Park Finding |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|-------------------|
| THEREFORE/BUT % | N/A (address evolution instead) | % | % |
| AND THEN % | N/A | % | % |
| Causal Binding Status | | | |

**Triangulation:**
- [ ] All protocols indicate strong causal binding
- [ ] All protocols indicate weak causal binding (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Mixed results (investigate discrepancy)

## 4. Character Arc Comparison

| Question | Fleabag Answer | Curb Answer | South Park Answer |
|----------|----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Do characters change? | (Confession breakthrough?) | (No hugging/learning?) | (Lesson is never lesson?) |
| Protagonist | | | |
| Supporting 1 | | | |
| Supporting 2 | | | |

**Protocol Conflict Analysis:**

Fleabag permits/requires emotional breakthrough. Curb forbids character growth. South Park requires no clear moral victor.

| Character | Fleabag Need | Curb Need | South Park Need | Resolution Strategy |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| | | | | |

## 5. Theme/Meaning Comparison

| Metric | Fleabag | Curb | South Park |
|--------|---------|------|------------|
| Core Theme | Core Wound | Social Contract Violated | "What is this about?" |
| Draft Finding | | | |
| Clarity Level | Clear / Unclear | Clear / Unclear | Clear / Unclear |

**Triangulation:**
- [ ] All protocols identify same thematic center → Strong
- [ ] Protocols identify different themes → Clarification needed
- [ ] No protocol finds clear theme → CRITICAL

**Unified Theme Statement (if possible):**
_______________________________________________

## 6. Structural Mechanism Comparison

### 6.1 Thread/Storyline Analysis

| Protocol | Structural Unit | Draft Count | Benchmark | Status |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| Fleabag | Direct address moments | | 2-4/scene | |
| Curb | Threads | | 2-4/episode | |
| South Park | A/B stories | | 2/episode | |

### 6.2 Collision/Climax Analysis

| Protocol | Climax Type | Present in Draft? | Quality Assessment |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Fleabag | Confession breakthrough | YES / NO | |
| Curb | Thread collision + catastrophe | YES / NO | |
| South Park | Extreme position clash | YES / NO | |

**Triangulation:**
- [ ] All protocols find satisfying climax → Strong
- [ ] Some protocols find climax issues → Specific revision needed
- [ ] All protocols flag climax weakness → CRITICAL

---

## 7. Humor/Tone Analysis

| Protocol | Humor Function | Draft Status |
|----------|----------------|--------------|
| Fleabag | Comedy as grief's bodyguard | Humor protects / doesn't protect |
| Curb | Embarrassment accumulation | Escalates / plateaus |
| South Park | Comedy earns license for extreme | Funny enough / not funny enough |

**Triangulation:**
- Humor serving multiple protocol functions simultaneously? YES / NO
- Humor withdrawal moment (Fleabag) at same point as catastrophe (Curb)? YES / NO
- Satirical extremity (South Park) creating embarrassment (Curb)? YES / NO

---

## 8. Setup/Payoff Analysis

| Protocol | Setup Type | Inventory Count | Payoffs Delivered | Orphans |
|----------|------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------|
| Fleabag | Confession seeds | | | |
| Curb | Bridge elements | | | |
| South Park | Thematic positions | | | |

**Universal Orphan Check:**
List any element flagged as orphan by ANY protocol:

| Element | Flagged By | Resolution: Add Payoff or Cut? |
|---------|------------|-------------------------------|
| | | |
| | | |

## 9. Convergence/Divergence Map

### 9.1 Points of Convergence (All Protocols Agree)

| Finding | Fleabag | Curb | South Park | Implication |
|---------|---------|------|------------|-------------|
| | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Structural strength |
| | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Structural strength |
| | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | CRITICAL weakness |

### 9.2 Points of Divergence (Protocols Disagree)

| Finding | Fleabag | Curb | South Park | Analysis |
|---------|---------|------|------------|----------|
| | ✓ | ✗ | — | Genre choice required |
| | — | ✓ | ✗ | Genre choice required |

### 9.3 Protocol-Specific Opportunities

| Protocol | Unique Opportunity Identified | Implementation Note |
|----------|------------------------------|---------------------|
| Fleabag | | |
| Curb | | |
| South Park | | |

## 10. Revision Priority Matrix

Based on triangulation, rank revision priorities:

### Tier 1: Critical (All Protocols Flag)

| Issue | Fleabag Diagnosis | Curb Diagnosis | South Park Diagnosis | Revision Action |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| | | | | |

### Tier 2: High (Two Protocols Flag)

| Issue | Protocols | Dissenting Protocol | Revision Action |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|-----------------|
| | + | | |

### Tier 3: Medium (One Protocol Flags)

| Issue | Flagging Protocol | Why Others Don't Flag | Revision Action |
|-------|-------------------|----------------------|-----------------|

## 13. Application Notes for *Open View* Drafts

### Draft-Specific Triangulation Hypotheses

**First Draft (2019-10-05):**
- Likely highest Fleabag affinity (surveillance as intimacy violator)
- Likely lowest Curb affinity (68% AND THEN per prior analysis)
- South Park potential in surveillance state satire

**Second Draft (2019-10-21):**
- Improved causal binding (78% per prior analysis)
- Character arc questions: Does Sus/Sis change?
- Thematic clarity: What is it ABOUT?

**Third Draft (2019-10-31):**
- Genre reset: More Curb-adjacent workplace texture?
- Clone mechanic: Fleabag double-confession potential
- Incomplete: Cannot assess climax/resolution

### Surveillance as Multi-Protocol Element

| Protocol | Surveillance Functions As... |
|----------|------------------------------|
| Fleabag | The audience within the world — characters are always "watched" |
| Curb | Infinite witness multiplier — maximum embarrassment at all times |
| South Park | Position to satirize — both pro-surveillance and anti-surveillance extremes |

| C | 20-29 | Significant structural work needed |
| D | 10-19 | Foundational revision required |
| F | 0-9 | Complete reconception needed |
