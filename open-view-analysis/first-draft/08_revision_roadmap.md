# *Open View* — Revision Roadmap

**Draft:** First Draft (2018-03-29)
**Analyst:** Claude (script-analysis-dramaturgical)
**Analysis Date:** 2026-01-25
**Protocol:** P7 Full Analytical Treatment
**Target:** Second Draft

---

## I. Revision Overview

### Current State

*Open View* First Draft is an ambitious but structurally incomplete script. It establishes a strong formal concept (quadrant overture, surveillance grammar), compelling themes (family as already dead, gaze as violence), and several non-submersible units (bathroom argument, Li's violence, Lef's death). However, it suffers from:

1. **Incomplete Third Act** — Script terminates mid-scene
2. **HQ Subplot Failure** — Consumes pages without integration
3. **Weak Causal Logic** — Game activation appears arbitrary
4. **Underdeveloped Key Beats** — Li's reveal, Rok's death, test mechanics

### Revision Philosophy

These recommendations aim to complete and strengthen the script while preserving its formal ambitions and thematic complexity. The goal is not to make *Open View* more commercial but to make it more effective at what it's attempting.

## II. Tier 1: Critical Revisions

### Revision R1: Complete Third Act

**Issue:** Script terminates at line 2810, mid-scene. "Tests" are described in narrative notes rather than dramatized. Resolution is absent.

**Target:** Add 15-25 pages of new material completing the following:

#### R1.1: Dramatize Test Sequences

**Current State:** Lines 2717 state: "They make them turn on each other, to fulfill a desire. But whoever decides to turn first is turned against them and they are the one killed."

**Required:**
- Write Sus's confrontation with Mis Sar in shower
- Clarify: Is Mis Sar real, hologram, or projection?
- Show Sus's choice (revenge) and its consequences
- Extend Rok's embrace of Gre and subsequent drowning
- Show parents' reactions on their TV screens

**Estimated Length:** 8-10 pages

#### R1.2: Dramatize Li's Reveal and Confrontation

**Current State:** Lines 2806-2810 are narrative notes: "Li starts to panic. She reaches out to the camera revealing herself to be in on the whole plan."

**Required:**
- Show Li reaching for camera/interface
- Show Lon blocking her access
- Dramatize confrontation with surviving family (Sus? Fre?)
- Reveal Li's motivation for collaboration
- Show consequences for Li

**Estimated Length:** 5-8 pages

#### R1.3: Resolution

**Current State:** None.

**Required:**
- What happens to Sus? (survivor? new participant?)
- What happens to Fre? (drugged; killed? saved?)
- What happens to Li? (exposed; killed? imprisoned?)
- What happens to HQ? (continues? destroyed? Lon's rebellion succeeds?)
- Final image that echoes opening (loop closes or breaks?)

**Estimated Length:** 3-5 pages

---

### Revision R2: Establish Causal Logic

**Issue:** The Black Box activates at TIMECODE 00:00:00 with no apparent trigger. The game seems arbitrary.

**Target:** Connect family action to game activation.

#### Options (choose one):

**Option A: Li's Collaboration Triggered It**
- Li knew the game was coming; her "wave of dread" at Lef's acceptance letters is because she knows what's scheduled
- Add line revealing Li scheduled the game as escape from marriage
- Thematic resonance: mother as destroyer

**Option B: Surveillance Threshold Exceeded**
- The family's dysfunction crossed a measurable threshold
- Add line from HQ about "dysfunction index" or "entertainment value"
- Thematic resonance: pathology becomes product

**Option C: Random Selection**
- Make explicit that selection is random/algorithmic
- "Series A" vs "Series B" becomes explanation of random selection
- Thematic resonance: anyone can be content; no one is safe

**Recommendation:** Option A creates strongest character motivation. Option B creates strongest thematic coherence. Option C preserves mystery but may feel unsatisfying.

**Effort:** LOW (1-2 lines if Option B/C; 3-5 lines if Option A)

---

### Revision R3: Decide HQ Subplot

**Issue:** HQ subplot (Wot, Jra, Lon) consumes ~300 lines without integrating into family story or explaining the game's purpose.

**Target:** Either develop fully or cut entirely.

#### Option A: Develop Fully

**Required additions:**
- Explain HQ's purpose (entertainment? experiment? justice?)
- Clarify Wot and Jra's conflict (succession? ethics? methodology?)
- Dramatize Lon's rebellion (what does she do? what does it accomplish?)
- Create at least one moment where HQ action affects family (beyond temperature control)
- Show HQ reacting to Li's reveal (she was their asset? their subject?)

**Estimated Addition:** 10-15 pages
**Net Change:** May require cutting other material to balance

#### Option B: Cut Entirely

**Required:**
- Remove lines 945-958 (HQ reveal)
- Remove lines 1372-1407 (Wot/Jra conversation)
- Remove lines 1409-1435 (control room shift change)
- Remove lines 1532-1541 (HQ reacts to Li's violence)
- Remove lines 1623-1670 (Lon watches HQ)
- Remove lines 1733-1760 (Jra unmasks)
- Remove lines 2604-2630 (Wot tests Jra)
- Remove lines 2794-2799 (Lon's revelation)

**Estimated Removal:** ~300 lines (~10%)
**Net Change:** Shorter, tighter script; mystery preserved but system remains abstract

#### Recommendation: Option B (Cut)

The HQ subplot currently adds complexity without payoff. Cutting it would:
- Streamline the script
- Preserve surveillance-as-mystery
- Allow more time for family drama
- Remove weak scenes (HQ scenes score lowest on three-things test)

If choosing Option B, the Black Box becomes the sole system presence, which strengthens its symbolic weight.

---

## III. Tier 2: High Priority Revisions

### Revision R4: Develop Li's Collaborator Reveal

**Issue:** Li's collaboration is revealed in two lines without motivation, confrontation, or consequences.

**Current State:** Line 2806: "Li starts to panic. She reaches out to the camera revealing herself to be in on the whole plan."

**Target:** Develop into a full dramatic sequence.

#### R4.1: Seed Earlier Hints

Add moments that retrospectively make sense:
- Li's calm during Black Box arrival (she expected it)
- Li's violence against Def (performance for cameras?)
- Li's coldness during Lef's death ("another bird taken care of")
- Li's positioning during tests (always near cameras)

**Estimated Addition:** 5-10 lines distributed across Acts I-II

#### R4.2: Dramatize the Reveal

Write the scene:
- Li attempts to contact HQ
- Her interface shows her operator status
- Surviving family member witnesses this
- Confrontation ensues

**Estimated Addition:** 3-5 pages

#### R4.3: Explain Motivation

Why did Li collaborate?
- Escape from marriage?
- Protection for one child (Sus)?
- Promised new life?
- Psychological compulsion?

One line of motivation would suffice; a short monologue would be better.

---

### Revision R5: Resolve Sus/Mis Sar Thread

**Issue:** Sexual abuse subplot is introduced with disturbing specificity, then abandoned until ambiguous "test."

**Current State:** Lines 1172-1248 establish abuse. Lines 2684-2782 show Mis Sar in shower; Sus chooses "revenge"; "Mis Sar isn't really there?"

**Target:** Clarify what happens and what it means.

#### Options:

**Option A: Mis Sar Is Real**
- Sus confronts her abuser
- Revenge is literal (Sus harms Mis Sar)
- Consequences for Sus (trauma? catharsis? guilt?)

**Option B: Mis Sar Is Projection/Hologram**
- Sus's "revenge" is symbolic/therapeutic
- She's processing trauma
- Game uses her psychology against her

**Option C: Mis Sar's Reality Is Ambiguous**
- Preserve the "isn't really there?" question
- But show Sus's emotional journey regardless

**Recommendation:** Option B preserves game's technological nature while exploring Sus's interiority. Add 2-3 pages showing Sus's internal confrontation with her abuse.

---

### Revision R6: Extend Rok's Drowning Sequence

**Issue:** Rok's death—the script's emotional climax—receives only 7 lines.

**Current State:** Lines 2770-2777: Rok enters shower, embraces Gre, door closes, water fills.

**Target:** Extend to 2-3 pages.

**Required:**
- Show Rok's recognition that this is death
- Show Gre's reaction (confusion? fear? reciprocation?)
- Show the embrace—desire finally expressed
- Show the water rising
- Show final moments—any last looks, words, gestures
- Show parents watching on screens (reaction shots)

---

## IV. Tier 3: Medium Priority Revisions

### Revision R7: Compress Prologue/Act I

**Issue:** Setup = 33% of script (target: 25%).

**Target:** Cut 50-100 lines.

**Candidates for Compression:**
- Lines 166-199 (establishing shots): Cut 2 of 3 angles
- Lines 411-560 (bathroom argument): Compress by 30 lines (preserve rhythm)
- Lines 706-768 (breakfast incest undertones): Compress by 20 lines
- Lines 857-918 (Lef's dreams): Keep but streamline

---

### Revision R8: Clarify Test Mechanics

**Issue:** Black Box announces "tests" but mechanics are murky.

**Target:** One clear statement of rules.

**Suggested Addition:**
- Black Box states: "You will each be offered what you most desire. Accept, and someone you love will suffer. Refuse, and you will suffer. How do you choose?"
- This clarifies the moral dilemma structure

---

### Revision R9: Resolve Fre's Final State

**Issue:** Fre is drugged after agreeing to kill Li. Then nothing.

**Target:** Show what happens.

**Options:**
- Fre is killed while drugged (tragic; his manipulation was for nothing)
- Fre awakens to discover his family destroyed (pathetic survivor)
- Fre's drugged agreement somehow triggers Li's exposure

## VI. Revision Metrics

### Target Second Draft

| Metric | Current | Target | Change |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| **Total Lines** | 2,810 | ~3,000-3,200 | +200-400 |
| **Act III** | Incomplete | Complete | +15-25 pages |
| **HQ Subplot** | ~300 lines | 0 lines (if cut) | -300 lines |
| **Setup Proportion** | 33% | 25% | -8% |
| **Causal Binding** | ~40% | >60% | +20% |

### Success Criteria

| Criterion | Metric |
|-----------|--------|
| Third act complete | All scenes dramatized; resolution exists |
| Causal logic established | Reader can articulate why this family was chosen |
| Li's reveal developed | Motivation clear; confrontation dramatized |
| Rok's death impactful | Sequence long enough for emotional effect |
| HQ resolved | Either integrated or removed |

---

## VII. Risk Assessment

### Risk 1: Overexplanation

**Concern:** Explaining the game's purpose may diminish its horror. Mystery can be more effective than clarity.

**Mitigation:** Opt for minimal explanation. One line about "dysfunction threshold exceeded" preserves mystery while providing causal trigger.

---

### Risk 2: Cutting HQ Loses World-Building

**Concern:** Removing HQ subplot may make the surveillance system too abstract.

**Mitigation:** The Black Box remains as physical presence. Its voice (chorus of women) provides enough system presence. The mystery of who watches may be more effective than seeing watchers.

---

### Risk 3: Extending Third Act Shifts Proportion

**Concern:** Adding 15-25 pages to Act III will increase its percentage.

**Mitigation:** Compress Acts I-II by 50-100 lines. Net change: +100-300 lines (acceptable for complete narrative).

---

### Risk 4: Li's Motivation May Alienate

**Concern:** Making Li a collaborator risks losing protagonist identification.

**Mitigation:** Her motivation must be comprehensible, even if not sympathetic. "I was promised I'd survive" is different from "I wanted my family dead." Consider making her collaboration coerced.
