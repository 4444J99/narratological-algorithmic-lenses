## Beat Map Key

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **#** | Beat number (sequential through entire script) |
| **Lines/Pages** | Script location (lines preferred if available) |
| **Setting** | Location + time of day |
| **Characters** | All characters present (protagonist bolded) |
| **Action** | What happens (objective description, 1-2 sentences) |
| **Function** | Structural purpose (see Function Taxonomy below) |
| **Tension** | Intensity level 1-10 (see Tension Scale below) |
| **Connector** | Causal relationship to prior beat |

### Connector Types

| Connector | Meaning | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **BUT** | Reversal, complication, obstacle | "He reaches the door BUT it's locked" |
| **THEREFORE** | Consequence, result, causation | "She confesses THEREFORE he leaves" |
| **MEANWHILE** | Parallel action (use sparingly) | "MEANWHILE at headquarters..." |
| **AND THEN** | Weak/episodic (flag for revision) | "AND THEN they went to dinner" |
| **â€”** | Opening beat (no prior connection) | First beat only |

### Function Taxonomy

| Function Code | Meaning |
|---------------|---------|
| SETUP | Establishes world, character, situation |
| HOOK | Captures attention, raises question |
| PLANT | Sets up future payoff |
| PAYOFF | Delivers on earlier plant |
| INCITE | Disrupts equilibrium, initiates problem |
| ESCALATE | Raises stakes, increases pressure |
| REVERSE | Changes direction, subverts expectation |
| REVEAL | Discloses information |
| TEST | Character faces obstacle |
| CHOICE | Character makes decision |
| CONSEQUENCE | Result of prior action |
| RELATIONSHIP | Develops character connection |
| THEMATIC | Articulates or embodies theme |
| TRANSITION | Moves between larger units |
| CLIMAX | Peak intensity, irreversible action |
| RESOLVE | Settles established question |

### Tension Scale

```
1-2: Low tension (domestic normal, exposition)
3-4: Rising tension (complications emerging)
5-6: Moderate tension (active conflict)
7-8: High tension (crisis approaching)
9-10: Peak tension (climax, major confrontation)
```

## Beat Statistics

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Total beats | [N] | |
| Average tension | [N.N] | Target: 5.0-6.0 for drama |
| Peak tension beats | [N] | Should be 3-5 for feature |
| Low tension beats (1-2) | [N] ([%]) | >20% may indicate pacing issues |
| **BUT connectors** | [N] ([%]) | Target: 30-40% |
| **THEREFORE connectors** | [N] ([%]) | Target: 40-50% |
| **MEANWHILE connectors** | [N] ([%]) | Target: <10% |
| **AND THEN connectors** | [N] ([%]) | **FLAG if >10%** |

### Causal Binding Score

```
CAUSAL_BINDING = (BUT + THEREFORE) / (TOTAL_CONNECTORS - 1) Ã— 100

Score: [N]%

Interpretation:
  >80%: Strong causal binding
  60-80%: Adequate binding, some episodic elements
  40-60%: Weak binding, significant revision needed
  <40%: Fundamental structural issue
```

## Flagged Beats

Beats requiring attention:

| Beat # | Issue | Recommendation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| [N] | AND THEN connector | Strengthen causal link |
| [N] | Tension drop without purpose | Justify or cut |
| [N] | Function unclear | Clarify scene's purpose |

## Usage Notes

1. **Completeness**: Every scene in the script must appear in the beat map. No gaps.

2. **Action Field**: Write objectively. "John argues with Mary" not "John selfishly attacks Mary."

3. **Function**: A beat can have multiple functions. List the primary function; note secondary functions in the Act Notes section.

4. **Tension Curve**: The visualization should show the actual shape of the script's intensity. Classic structure has rising tension with periodic releases.

5. **Connector Discipline**: Be honest about AND THEN connectors. Identifying them is the first step to fixing them.

6. **Statistics**: The numbers are diagnostic, not prescriptive. An unconventional structure may have unconventional numbers that still work.

7. **Flagged Beats**: These become inputs for the Revision Roadmap.
