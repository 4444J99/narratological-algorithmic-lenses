## II. DRAMATIC SPINE

```
THESIS STATEMENT (from Black Box, line 2415):
"We force families apart that should never be put back together again. 
You are to be splayed, weighed, and displayed."

CONTROLLING IDEA:
In a surveillance society, the nuclear family becomes both prison and 
entertainment productâ€”observed, judged, and ultimately destroyed for 
an audience's edification.

CENTRAL DRAMATIC QUESTION:
Will this family survive the night? (Answer: Noâ€”but survival was never the point.)

PROTAGONIST:
Ensemble with Li as most active agent. She initiates divorce, maintains affair, 
commits violence, and is revealed as collaborator. Her arc: from apparent 
victim to complicit participant.

ANTAGONIST:
The surveillance apparatus (HQ/Black Box/automated house)â€”institutional, 
distributed, feminine-coded (all-woman control room). The family is also 
antagonist to itself.

STRUCTURAL MODE:
Hybrid of domestic chamber drama + techno-thriller + reality TV critique + 
body horror. Closest analogues: Haneke's Funny Games meets Black Mirror's 
"White Bear" meets Fassbinder's domestic melodramas.

## III. FIVE-MOVEMENT STRUCTURE

The script operates closer to **European art cinema structure** than classical 
Hollywood three-act. Five distinct movements:

## X. TIMECODE STRUCTURE

| TIMECODE | LINE | EVENT | NARRATIVE POSITION |
|----------|------|-------|-------------------|
| -08:37:98 | 156 | End of prologue | Deep in countdown |
| -00:07:37 | 589 | Black Box dropped | 7+ minutes to zero |
| -00:00:00 | 667 | Rok brings Black Box inside | GAME BEGINS |
| (implicit) | 2016+ | Alarm; Lef crisis | Past zero; consequences |
| 7-4 countdown | 2415-2450 | Black Box mandate | Final countdown |

**Note**: The timecode implies a structure where the family has been observed for 8+ hours before the "game" officially begins at 00:00:00. Everything before the Black Box is prologue; everything after is the test.

## XI. CAMERA GRAMMAR ANALYSIS

| CATEGORY | EXAMPLES | COUNT | % | FUNCTION |
|----------|----------|-------|---|----------|
| **BODY CAMS** | Li's, Fre's, Sus's, Rok's Body Cam | ~48 | 32% | Distributed subjectivity |
| **DOMESTIC INFRASTRUCTURE** | Ceiling Vent, Above Fridge, Drug Dispenser, Mirror Sconce | ~22 | 15% | House watches |
| **PERSONAL DEVICES** | Laptop Selfie, Mobile Phone, Tablet | ~18 | 12% | Self-surveillance |
| **INSTITUTIONAL** | Security Cam, Front Door, Metro, Gym | ~20 | 13% | Public surveillance |
| **VEHICULAR** | Car Interior, Windshield, Cab, Gutter | ~12 | 8% | Transit as observed |
| **HQ/META** | Control Room, Queen's Lounge, Lon's Quarters | ~14 | 9% | Watchers watching |
| **LEF/DREAM** | Grow Tank, Vitals, Dream Monitor | ~10 | 7% | Interior/imagined |
| **UNSPECIFIED** | Various | ~6 | 4% | |
| **TOTAL** | | ~150 | 100% | |

**Key Insight**: The script uses approximately 150 camera source designations across 117 beats. The grammar insists that every moment is observed, archived, retrievable.

## XII. STRUCTURAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### A. UNDERDEVELOPED ELEMENTS

1. **HQ Rules**: "Series A" vs "Series B" never explained. The full ruleset of the "game" is opaque.

2. **Lon's Rebellion**: Introduced (line 1427: "she's here to burn it down") but never dramatized. Her actions in lines 2794-2799 are narrative summary.

3. **Li's Collaboration**: Final twist (lines 2804-2810) is stated, not shown. When did she join? What's her motivation? How does this reframe earlier scenes?

4. **The "Choice" Mechanics**: 
   - How do the buttons work? 
   - What was the "correct" answer? 
   - Was there a way to save both Gre and the sibling?
   - Was Mis Sar real or holographic?

5. **Line 2717**: "They make them turn on each other, to fulfill a desire. But whoever decides to turn first it is turned against them and they are the one killed." This is a SCRIPT NOTE, not a scene. Needs dramatization.

### B. PROPORTIONAL ISSUES

| SECTION | CURRENT | RECOMMENDED |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Climax (tests + choices) | ~100 lines | ~300 lines |
| Li reveal | ~6 lines | ~50 lines |
| Lon's rebellion | ~20 lines | ~80 lines |
| Resolution/Coda | 0 lines | ~50 lines |

### C. TONAL CALIBRATION

The first two acts sustain a register of **quotidian dread** (domestic drama + surveillance unease). The third act shifts to **action-horror** (locked house, boiling child, moral tests). The transition is abrupt. Consider:

- Slower ratcheting of tension in late Act Two
- The door-traps-foot beat (line 2167) is effectiveâ€”extend this logic earlier
- More beats of the house "malfunctioning" before full siege

## XV. REVISION PRIORITIES

### CRITICAL (Structural)
1. Dramatize lines 2714-2810 (climax through reveal) as full scenes
2. Establish HQ rules earlier (Act One or early Act Two)
3. Plant Li's collaboration through Act Two (rewatch value)
4. Add resolution/coda

### IMPORTANT (Character)
1. Deepen Sus's interiority beyond symptomatology
2. Give Rok a scene where desire is acknowledged to self
3. Clarify Lon's motivation and endgame

### POLISH (Craft)
1. Calibrate tonal transition from domestic drama to horror
2. Review camera grammar for consistency
3. Address line 2717 (narrative intrusion)
